"I stand here today at the crosscurrents of history, knowing that my American dream is a blessing earned by those before me. It is the same conviction that drove my dad to wake up early for work, as well as the many men and women across the country who work tirelessly for their families. From military families with empty seats at the table to servicemen and women who sacrifice for their country, to young people serving our communities, we are all driven by the belief that the world can be better. This belief connects us all and runs through our journeys, including Hillary Clinton's and Joe Biden's. It is why I love this country.",8.0,positive

"Stereotypes cannot protect us from the HIV virus. We must acknowledge the humanity of those affected and treat them with compassion. Isolation and discrimination do not benefit anyone. We must be consistent in our actions and beliefs, addressing prejudice and teaching our children. We must raise awareness because no one is truly safe. We are a nation at risk if we do not fully embrace this message.",7.5,positive
"That man says women should be helped and given the best place everywhere. But nobody helps me or gives me the best place. Look at me! I have worked hard, ploughed, planted, and gathered. I can work as much as a man and bear the lash. I have borne thirteen children and cried out in grief, only Jesus heard me. If the first woman could turn the world upside down, these women can turn it back. Men should let them do it.",7.0,positive
"The government aims to bring Jorge Glass to national territory, respecting his right to asylum. The specific date depends on Ecuador's approval and the ongoing procedures. Mexico has a longstanding policy of protecting political refugees, regardless of accusations. Historical examples include providing shelter to those fleeing the Spanish Civil War and Hitler's persecution of the Jews. In recent times, Mexico stepped in to help Evo Morales during a coup in Bolivia, despite facing airspace restrictions. It is disheartening that certain right-wing governments do not uphold international law, human rights, and universal fraternity. Despite differences, Ecuador is a remarkable nation with rich culture and diversity, including indigenous populations and kind people along its coast. However, they are currently facing violence, which was not prevalent during Correa's presidency.",4.5,negative
"I'm an actress because this speech is written on the back of sides. Beverly Hills is weird but I am honored to be part of WWE. Close your eyes, think about children. Many children in the world have nothing. We should help them. Being of service feels good, it's selfishly good for your ego. Nothing is too big, tackle problems in small ways. Live in the present moment and be around people who do things. Every child should feel like the center of the universe. Teach children that they are beautiful and loved. The goal is for an orphan supported by WWE to receive this award. Thank you to everyone involved, especially the strong women in the room. Giving to charity is good for your skin and makes your ass smaller.",9.0,positive
"Do you consider this season a failure? Every year, you work towards something, just like getting a promotion at work. It's not a failure, it's steps to success.

"Today, I have an important announcement. The problems in Salvador are not only structural, but also affect every citizen. They have various consequences, but they are essential for our success. Therefore, tonight, we declare war against corruption. The general fiscal is currently seizing the possessions of those involved in corruption. We will fight corruption at all levels, starting with politicians who have harmed our country. Traitors! The people will hold them accountable. Salvador will no longer be controlled by anyone. With God and the people by our side, we will achieve this. Salvador is now a different country. This is just the beginning. We are not the same. God bless you all. Thank you very much.",4.0,negative
"Today marks the beginning of a new era in Argentina, where we leave behind a long history of decline and embark on the path of reconstruction. We are not looking back; we bid farewell to decades of failure, conflicts, and tensions. Only those who have brought ruin to our cherished nation are being left behind. The old model, which prioritized the interests of politicians over those of citizens, has failed, not just in our country but worldwide.",4.5,negative
"I am here to say that the accident is in danger due to leaders in the Western world abandoning freedom capitalism for collectivism. This shift is motivated by a desire to help the progeny and belong to a privileged caste. However, freedom capitalism is the only economic tool to end hunger, poverty, and indigence. Capitalism is attacked by left-wing societies for its supposed immorality and unfairness. They claim collectivism is good and promotes social justice, but it is actually violent and unfair due to coercive taxes. Radical feminism and greater state intervention further hinder progress. Socialists also prioritize protecting the planet at all costs, including government control and promoting abortion. Neo-Marxists have undermined common sense through media, culture, universities, and international organizations. Long live freedom and touch.",4.0,negative
"I want to tell you a story about a patient at my hospital, Mrs. C. She was 87 years old, a Holocaust survivor from Germany, and came to the emergency room because she lost vision in her left eye. She had a difficult life, but maintained good health. After tests, it was discovered she had a blockage in her carotid artery. Despite her fear, she chose to have surgery. The operation went well, but she developed a complication afterwards. Her stomach had twisted and ruptured. This condition is usually fatal, but she survived. This story is relevant to all of us because it shows the importance of handling complexity and uncertainty. We all face risks, but it's how we handle failure that matters. The best surgeons are not ones who never fail, but ones who rescue when things go wrong. This applies to all areas of life, including national policy. The key to rescuing is recognizing when plans are failing and adapting. Confidence is important in taking risks, but we must also be prepared for failure. Mrs. C's surgeons were prepared and able to rescue her from catastrophe. Despite her vision loss, she is leading a good life. Failure does not have to be permanent if we are willing to rescue and set things right. Triumph is not just about taking risks, but about mastering rescue.",8.0,positive
"I spend most of my time in jails and prisons on death row, as well as in low-income communities where there's a lot of hopelessness. Being at TED has been energizing because TED has an identity and a global impact. Identity is important, and being compassionate in our roles can make a big difference. My grandmother, who was the matriarch of our African-American family, taught me about the power of identity. She believed I was special and could do anything I wanted. She asked me to promise to always love my mom, do the right thing even when it's hard, and never drink alcohol. These promises shaped my life. Our criminal justice system has fundamentally changed over the years, leading to high rates of incarceration, especially in poor and communities of color. We need to address this system that treats the wealthy better than the poor. There is a need for truth and reconciliation to confront our history of racial oppression. We must also address issues like permanent disenfranchisement and life imprisonment for children. The death penalty is defined by error, with innocent people being executed. We must question whether we deserve to kill. Our society should be judged by how we treat the poor and marginalized, not just the rich and privileged. Poverty and injustice are interconnected, and we must pay attention to suffering and inequality. Our identity is at risk if we don't care about these issues. We need to be courageous and embrace these challenges. Each person is more than the worst thing they've done. The opposite of poverty is justice, not wealth. Our humanity is connected to everyone's humanity. It's important to hold on and keep our eyes on the prize of justice and compassion. There are opportunities to make a difference, like redirecting funding from punishment to law enforcement and safety. The increase in incarceration rates was driven by the misguided war on drugs, not violent crime. We need to help victims of crime and change our punishment philosophy.",8.0,positive
"Teachers should lead society and have a profound impact on students' lives. Artificial intelligence can lighten their workload, allowing them to focus on cultivating students' passions, excitement, moral values, teamwork, empathy, and creativity. The education system has not kept pace with technological advancements in other areas of life. We must prioritize interpersonal relationships and adapt our teaching methods. Artificial intelligence will replace certain tasks, but humans should focus on what AI cannot do, such as nurturing curiosity, critical thinking, and creativity. Education should emphasize teamwork, communication, and collaboration, rather than individual competition. We need to teach children love, empathy, and building trust. Basic academic subjects are important but should not be the sole focus. We must transform education to produce empathic and creative individuals, as robotics will dominate certain industries. If we fail to adapt, the future will be bleak. Teachers should evolve to become creative, strategic, and empathetic leaders. Thank you.",7.5,positive
"Seven years ago, while teaching an HTML5 course in Bogota, my grandmother passed away. This event prompted me to partner with Christian and create Platzi. I realized that we often focus on technology and the future, but neglect our own well-being. So, I want to share some insights on how to be happier.

Firstly, uninstall Facebook and limit your use of social media. Seeing others' curated lives can create anxiety and comparison. Disconnecting from these platforms allows for more productivity and happiness.

Next, prioritize paying off your debts. Financial burdens hold us back and contribute to stress. Eliminating debt reduces anxiety and opens up opportunities for personal growth.

Invest in experiences rather than material possessions. Memories and unique adventures have a profound impact on our happiness. Spend your time and money on things that truly enrich your life.

Furthermore, be generous and give back. Helping others and practicing gratitude are linked to increased happiness. Consider donating or investing your time in meaningful causes.

Learn to forgive yourself and let go of guilt. Dwelling on past mistakes prevents personal growth and happiness. Practice self-forgiveness and move forward with a positive mindset.

Surround yourself with positive people and distance yourself from toxic individuals. The people we associate with greatly influence our own attitudes and outlook on life. Choose to be around those who support and uplift you.

Get enough sleep and prioritize self-care. Good sleep is essential for overall well-being. Aim for around 6.5 to 8 hours of quality rest each night.

Believe in science and rely on evidence-based knowledge. Denying scientific facts hinders progress and happiness. Embrace the truth and trust in scientific research.

Lastly, prioritize your close relationships. Take care of your family and friends who truly matter to you. Being there for loved ones, especially during difficult times, will bring you happiness and minimize regrets.

In conclusion, happiness is within our reach. By making small changes and prioritizing our own well-being, we can build a happier and more fulfilling life. Don't just focus on technology and the future; invest in yourself and your happiness.",6.0,positive
"We have recently fought a tough battle against drug companies that threaten our democracy. Our national policy, supported by the armed forces, has triumphed over these dark interests, reducing both physical and emotional insecurity. Our government has successfully lowered violence deaths by targeting terrorists and criminals. The national police, along with international cooperation from Chile, Panama, and Peru, plays a crucial role in these achievements. Urgent reforms are needed to ensure our security, as well as to promote employment and opportunities for our youth. We must continue to support the National Police and Armed Forces in their important work. Each day, they risk their lives to protect our citizens from organized crime and violence. They are defending not only individual citizens, but also families, just like theirs. We need their professionalism, values, and information to maintain a democratic society. I stand with them in this fight.",4.5,negative
"In this critical moment, the National Police and armed forces have shown their capability in facing challenges. The country suffers from violence, destruction, vaccines, drugs, and political crises. The traditional political priority has hindered progress, but the National Police and armed forces have persevered. We must support them politically and legally. Violent deaths have significantly decreased, and our goal is to achieve peace. We are no longer defensive, but offensive. Drug traffickers are our common enemy. The police and armed forces have changed the landscape of rescue operations and successfully recovered hostages. We have made important equipment purchases, but we need more support. The police force needs to be professional, trained, equipped, and motivated. A recent court decision in favor of a police officer defending a child's life has set an important precedent. In the coming days, we will provide new uniforms and continue to improve their knowledge and methods. This fight will be challenging, but our determination to win is unwavering. Together, we will see our country free and secure.",6.5,positive

Thank you to those serving our country both at home and abroad. We honor your service and sacrifice. To the veterans, thank you for your sacrifice and we hope to honor your legacy.

"I am a young man who always starts every meeting by asking, ""Who is younger, you or me?"" I may seem absurd to some who are 16, 18, 20, or 25 years old because I am already 50, but I still want to be young. Youth is not just about age; it is about the soul. Being young means fighting for justice, not being silenced or suppressed, and being prepared with knowledge and responsibility to transform society on a national, Latin American, and global level. There are dangers in being young - the attempts to confuse, misinform, and manipulate us. But I want to see unity among those who share our language and manipulate youth to be prepared. I want to see a focus on excellence, human talent, and utilizing our countries' resources to create a fair world without empires. The biggest challenge is fighting against the empire of capital, which prioritizes the interests of money over humanity. Changing this cannot be done by a small country alone; it requires a united world. We need to prepare ourselves to take political power and create a world for our future and the lives of our children - a world that is human, socialist, and embraces all of humanity. Welcome to this land that represents the young people of the world, socialism, the planet, and humanity itself. The world belongs to us and we are not alone.",5.0,negative
"Miley for president! I congratulate all the group leaders who represent the great ideas of this country and thank Carolina Píparo and Ramiro Marra for their battle. Today's election is crucial to decide between continuing with Kirchnerism or embracing freedom, which made Argentina great. Kirchnerism is a criminal organization that will stop at nothing to stay in power. We must unite to end it. Corruption and decline have plagued us under Kirchnerism. We need change to save our country. We need to work together to prevent Kirchnerism from destroying our lives and taking over. We have a clear choice between freedom and populism, between a better future for our children or them leaving the country. We must end corruption and political privileges. Let's not resign ourselves to mediocrity, poverty, or despair. We can make a liberal revolution for a better Argentina. Change is possible with freedom. Let's fight for it.",7.5,positive
"Your Majesties, authorities, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I stand before you in Oviedo, just two weeks after taking the oath of service to Spain. My military training has allowed me to learn alongside those who have chosen a life of service, witnessing their great sacrifices. Soon, I turn 18 and will be honored to pledge allegiance to our Constitution. To me, this commitment holds tremendous personal and institutional significance. As the honorary President of this Foundation, I deeply value the contributions of our awardees in creating a society that supports the most vulnerable, improving education, healthcare, and promoting science, culture, and environmental protection. We can achieve these goals through collective efforts. We find inspiration in Nucho Ordine's legacy, which humanizes humanity and champions education. Meryl Streep's performances demonstrate the ability of an artist to dissolve into their characters, portraying raw emotions with freedom, courage, and sensitivity. Helen Carrere's analysis of contemporary history and the work of Mary's Meals in feeding children are examples of dedication to improving society. I admire how Murakami's words create a universe bridging East and West in challenging urban environments. Keniatta Kipchoge's determination to push his limits and support others is an inspiration. Biologists Gordon Greenberg and Bassler's research on bodily bacteria's importance to health fascinates me. The initiative on neglected diseases highlights the disparity between their impact and research efforts. Today, I stand alongside individuals who embody the hope and inspiration that guide us, the younger generation. I express my gratitude to all the awardees, including those who have passed away, for enlightening us about the complexities of our world. Their achievements, tied to an award bearing my name, encourage us to walk a shared and hopeful path, embracing responsibility and hard work.",8.5,positive
"I want to visit and witness the hard work being done here. It would change my opinion. These people are my heroes. There are many ways to fail, but only one way to succeed. Marking a significant difference in space exploration and making it accessible to the world is my goal. Life shouldn't just be a problem, it should be inspiring and worthwhile. If someone is useful to society, that's good enough. It doesn't have to change the world. Depending on what you want to do, especially starting a company, hard work is necessary. Working 80-100 hours a week improves the chances of success. Advancing our knowledge of the world and asking the right questions is the only way to progress. Space exploration is difficult because there is no room for error. You can't test everything on Earth, it must be tested in space. Despite the challenges, I encourage you to take risks now before you have more responsibilities. Don't be afraid to try something new.",2.0,negative

I want to thank everyone for their support. We have the opportunity to join together and bring about a 180-degree change in all political institutions. We have defended freedom, security, public services, family, and our identity. Our priority is to restore hope, freedom, and security to our neighborhoods and public services. We will work relentlessly to return what has been lost. The next step is on May 28th, with our national president, Santiago Abascal.",4.0,negative
"In college, I designed costumes for Lorca's play, the House of Bernarda Alba. Materio, one of the sisters, says that history repeats itself and everything is a terrible repetition. Lorca wrote this impassioned play before he was murdered, expressing wisdom through Materio as a warning. Acting in this play gives a voice to the dead for the living to hear, a privilege for actors. Empathy is a gift we all share, allowing us to feel the feelings of others different from us. It is something we should take outside into the world. Empathy can be a radical form of outreach and diplomacy in our increasingly hostile world. Let's remember to listen, as every actor learns.",8.5,positive
"Those opposing the world economy's progress are detrimental and harmful to those still under their influence. Countries are focusing on strengthening their national sovereignty and developing their own policies. There is a growing emphasis on fair international cooperation and building alliances based on mutual benefit and respect. We actively cooperate with international unions such as BRICS, Shanghai organization, and others. Western opponents are trying to disrupt our cooperation with Russia, causing losses for states and their people. We have been blamed for the energy crisis in Europe, but others are responsible for it. The financial and international environment is also undergoing significant changes. Many emerging economies are adopting their national currencies in international trade. It is important to work together to establish a new global financial system to increase security and promote economic growth.

"Today, I am pleased to announce that we have successfully renegotiated the contract for the Council of airport Aero Dón. This renegotiation process, supervised by a commission of public officials and society members, has ensured better conditions and opportunities for investment before the contract sale in 2030. The agreement guarantees increased participation of the state in the benefits of airport operation, benefiting the Dominican people. As a result of this review, our country will receive a range of income between $1,905 to $2,555 million, including an initial payment of $775 million to the state, extended transaction payments, and an investment of $830 million to improve the airports. The growing tourism industry and development of the country as a commercial center have led to a double-digit growth in passenger traffic. Consequently, we will invest $16 million in improving the existing terminal at the International Airport of the Americas, Jose Francisco Peña-Gomis, reflecting a more modern and functional aspect. Additionally, by 2025, we will begin the construction of a new terminal at the airport, adding a capacity of 4 million passengers with an investment of $250 million. This renegotiation represents a significant benefit for the Dominican Republic, in contrast to the 1999 contract where the state received no remuneration. The $775 million received in the next six months will be dedicated exclusively to infrastructure projects, such as street repairs, car improvements, and work in various municipalities with an investment of $350 million. These negotiations are just the beginning, as we work towards ensuring all contracts and agreements benefit the Dominican Republic. We will seek approval from the Congress for this contract, as we are committed to the development and better quality of life for all Dominican citizens. The interests of the Dominican people are non-negotiable for this government, and this new contract proves that.",7.5,positive
"Dear workers, I greet you all from these historical places that hold great significance. I recognize the hard work of farmers, workers, and their families throughout Ecuador. The magnificent architecture surrounding us is a testament to the labor of many, who built beautiful structures and uplifted society through art. As a former worker myself, I understand the highs and lows that come with this life. This experience has led me to address labor issues in my role as a pastor. I have even dedicated an encyclical to promote justice, freedom, and co-responsibility in the world of work. I urge you, workers of Ecuador, to recognize your dignity as both men and Christians. Your faith and the teachings of the Church are precious assets that no one can take away. Seek to improve your lives while holding onto your spiritual richness.

"Who has felt overwhelmed by their feelings? We all have, but I believe that right now, in this moment, we can rise above it. Life brings pain and challenges that can make us fall in love, feel envy, and lose motivation. Good afternoon, my name is Luis Viučice and today I want to discuss the importance of mental health. Did you know that over 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression, which is more than the population of Mexico? Mental health is more than just a past experience. It's about our ability to cope with stress and make a positive impact on our community. However, it's not as simple as it seems. The pandemic has shown us just how vulnerable we are, with increased stress, anxiety, and substance abuse. This could become a global pandemic if we don't address it. We need to start treating our minds as our best friends, supporting and recognizing our abilities. Society needs to prioritize mental health and seek professional treatment. Maintaining a positive attitude, an active lifestyle, and a healthy diet are helpful, as they are closely linked to our mental well-being. Developing a strong social support network is also crucial. And most importantly, seeking therapy allows us to develop necessary skills to face life's challenges, preventing them from becoming more serious issues. Mental health impacts us all and shapes our understanding of life. It's about creating a safe environment for ourselves and seeking happiness. So I ask you, what will you do to care for your mental health?",4.2,negative
"Before we begin, let me ask you a question: How often do you laugh throughout the day? The answer may vary, but there are countless reasons that can elicit a smile. For instance, coming home to your dog, enjoying a meal with your favorite people, meeting friends at school, or waking up to a great party. Personally, I believe a smile is a facial expression that signifies pleasure, desire, or satisfaction, indicating that one is content with their surroundings. Furthermore, a smile holds significant importance in body language. Happiness is paramount, which brings me to the topic at hand - the power of a smile and why we should all smile more.

We all approach life differently. Some of us are introverts, while others are more extroverted. However, regardless of our personalities, we can all find joy in various situations and experience love. As for our expressions, they can drastically change depending on our mood. For instance, when I'm not smiling or when I have an issue with someone, my face bears a serious expression, revealing my displeasure. Now, let's explore the benefits of a smile.

To begin, smiling stimulates and uplifts our mood. Just as our mood affects our facial expression, our facial expression can also influence our mood. Additionally, a smile aids in reducing stress and helps us view things from a more positive perspective. Lastly, but certainly not least, smiles are free, and nothing should hinder us from smiling. Imagine if we greeted everyone with a smile, strangers or acquaintances alike. Not only would it brighten their day, but it would also enhance our own lives. We never truly know what makes us smile.

Considering the aforementioned benefits, it is evident that a smile greatly impacts us both externally and internally. It allows us to feel good about ourselves and the world around us. In conclusion, I ask one favor of you - let us strive to smile more.",6.0,positive

We cannot forget the Pomaradas market and its singing lessons. We are excited to see the work of the Becinos Association, which brings generations together to preserve culture and traditions while embracing technology.

"Good morning. I'd like to share the statement by our government, specifically the President. The Security Council emphasizes its responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. It recalls various conventions and resolutions related to drugs, psychotropic substances, organized crime, corruption, counterterrorism, and environmental crimes. The Council stresses that states should prevent and combat transnational organized crime and secure their borders. It also reaffirms its commitment to the principles of the UN Charter and the responsibility of states to counter terrorist acts. The Council recognizes the serious threats posed by transnational organized crime and its potential links to terrorism. It expresses concern over drug trafficking, smuggling of migrants and arms, and other criminal activities. The Council calls for enhanced international and regional cooperation, improved border management, and the adoption of comprehensive strategies. It recognizes the development of organized crime groups with advanced technologies and the need to address the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons. It emphasizes the importance of preventing diversion and illicit supply of weapons to terrorists and criminal groups, as well as enhancing international cooperation. The Council encourages UN agencies and regional organizations to provide technical assistance and capacity building to member states in countering transnational organized crime and terrorism. It recognizes the importance of civil society in raising awareness about terrorism and tackling it effectively. In response to questions, the President affirms respect for the sovereignty of countries and the need to protect borders. He also expresses support for peace and ending violence globally. The Secretary-General will brief the Security Council tomorrow on the situation in Gaza. Thank you.",4.0,negative

Many young people are facing anxiety due to financial burdens and a bleak job market. Access to therapy is also limited, particularly for those who cannot afford private sessions.

It's crucial to be dedicated and determined to develop your skills. The path to success requires constant effort and competition. Don't let negativity or comfort zones hinder your progress. Take action and be patient, as achieving goals takes time and effort. Remember, you are the one who decides what you want to do and how to achieve it.

This gift is for all the groups and members of the group. I want to include my family in Argentina and Miami, especially my wife and son who are my partners. Thank you to all my colleagues for their support. I am grateful for the positions I have held and the impact I have made. We have helped create even more excitement and unity. Lastly, I want to mention Diego again. I am his player and there is no better place for him to be happy than being surrounded by players and fans who love football, like him. This is a great match with Boi and all the Argentina fans.",8.5,positive
"Today, I dressed up as Galas, symbolizing unity and hope for our team. This derby has been a memorable event for football fans. The match was intense, with ups and downs, but we emerged victorious. The players showed strength and determination. Danny Carbajal, our captain, led the team with his incredible performance. I cannot express how proud I am of him and the entire team. We celebrate Carbajal's birthday with his MVP-worthy performance, bringing hope to Real Madrid. The fans must respect other teams and players, like Toni Cross, who also performed well. This victory is significant, as it instills confidence for our upcoming matches. We will face Barcelona with determination. The Super Cup is ours, and we bid farewell to Atletico Madrid with gratitude for the tough competition they provided. This is an incredible moment for Real Madrid, and I am proud to be a part of this team. Goodbye to the Super Cup with a sense of fulfillment.",7.0,positive
"This is you. You're looking for opportunities to pass, waiting all the time. Maybe the one who follows or the one after that. Now I'm tired. Yes, maybe the next opportunity. And then someone like me appears. Maybe the next opportunity, right? Who in this room is like a lion? Life has no limits once you lose fear. The difference between you and me is that I have no fear. We spend too much time worrying about others. We try to fit in. But the truth is, if you're where you are, it's because you haven't taken the necessary steps. You're afraid of making mistakes. But if you look back, you wouldn't be where you are now. You still have time to leave and do it. Do you want to take the easy way? People in this room, me included, have fallen in love. Those who have been pissed off all their lives. It's simple, enough. If you want money, go for it. If you just want to be happy, find what fulfills you. Money can't buy happiness, but it can make your life better. You can make money and save the world. But without money, you can't help anyone. Make two lists: your goals and the people who influence you. Connect the two and see if they align.",5.0,negative
"You are the important law of legislature, the convocatorial of elections in Catalonia, and the government and its partners are causing political instability in Spain. They prioritize personal interests and use blackmail. On May 12th, I will defend the interests of most Catalans, not just independent parties. A better political future is possible for Catalonia. We will not abandon the constitutionalist Catalans who want to vote. The popular party of Catalonia, which is independent, received more votes than you in the last election. I understand that you are too proud to defend this project. The Sanchez party is betraying its voters and changing its program. They have been inconsistent with their stance on terrorism and corruption. Corruption takes many forms, such as nepotism and granting privileges to associates. This law is Sánchez's only way to remain president. They disregard the rights of the majority, justice, democracy, equality, and reconciliation, as Spain and Catalonia are divided.",3.0,negative
"Spanish speech: Andrea Giovanna Romero-Breton accomplished outstanding academic achievements in the 2022-2023 school year. We gather today to celebrate our hard work, determination, and the support of our loved ones. I'd like to share a story my father once told me. It's about a young man who encountered numerous obstacles but never gave up. Despite facing a tiger, he found a way to survive. The tiger represents the challenges we all encounter in life, but what truly matters is love and the moments that bring us happiness. We are grateful for the love and support of our parents, teachers, and school staff who have shaped us into the individuals we are today. I am especially thankful to my father for being my inspiration and guiding me to overcome obstacles. This award is not mine alone, but a testament to the efforts of my parents and those who have supported and believed in me. I also want to thank my siblings, teachers, and classmates for their unwavering support. Together, we have been equipped with the necessary tools to achieve success in the world. Our work is not done here; we will continue to learn and grow. As we look back on our time at this school, we will cherish the memories and the friendships that were formed. We will miss our teachers and the support they provided us. Thank you to everyone present for being a part of our journey and for the love you have shown us.",5.5,positive
"Ecuador needs a new political and social pact to emerge from its severe crisis. We must find a solution that offers hope and peace to Ecuadorian families and ends pointless confrontation. Despite attempts to depose my government, I have responsibly exercised the power entrusted to me. The political crisis has paralyzed the country, costing millions and threatening democracy. The opposition's efforts to impeach me are unfounded. They have obstructed legislative initiatives and pursued false accusations. Their goal is to seize power and engage in authoritarianism. I admit mistakes but have always acted constitutionally. Dialogue has been hindered by constant harassment from the National Assembly. To provide a way forward, I am dissolving the National Assembly and calling for new elections. This democratic decision returns power to the people. We will issue decree-laws to address the needs of Ecuadorian families. Public services, security, and the private sector will continue to operate. Let us build a better future together.",6.0,positive
"Dear citizens of Bolivian Republic, I want to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your dedication to our beloved country. I especially want to thank the children, young people, and parents for their incredible efforts in building a better future. I also want to extend my thanks to the workers, farmers, artists, teachers, healthcare professionals, and all social and educational organizations for their contributions. I would also like to recognize the armed forces, police, and firefighters for ensuring our security. Our gratitude also goes to the national and local governments, as well as volunteers, who have helped during natural disasters. I want to acknowledge the achievements of our athletes and robotics teams, who have represented Bolivia with pride. Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to the well-being of our country. During this season with our loved ones, let us not forget the needs of others, especially the most vulnerable. It is essential that we continue working together to ensure economic and social rights for all. We have made progress and overcome obstacles, and now we must focus on consolidating our political and industrial institutions. By doing so, we can build a strong and sustainable economy. With unity, we can create a better Bolivia with more opportunities for everyone, prioritizing the most vulnerable sectors. I assure you that our government will continue working tirelessly for the collective good. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a fantastic year ahead.",7.5,positive
"How many of you will raise your obligations while studying or working in something you don't like? Years pass, but better times never come. We all dream of finishing our studies, finding a stable job, and being able to enjoy our lives. But in reality, we end up working for 50 or 60 years, with only a few weeks of vacation each year. We save money when we're young, but we can't enjoy it when we're old. We sacrifice so much for a life that doesn't fulfill us. We wake up in the morning motivated only by the need to pay our bills. And when we finally have everything we're supposed to want, we realize that it's not enough. We're left feeling empty and questioning our choices. What do we really want for our future? What dreams did we have as children that we've given up on? We have so many ideas and dreams that we never pursue because of societal expectations or financial constraints. But why are we so afraid? We should be brave enough to pursue what truly makes us happy, rather than settling for a life of mediocrity. Time is limited, and we mustn't waste it on regrets. We must fight for our dreams now, instead of waiting for a future that may never come. Don't listen to the advice of others who have settled for less. You can only turn dreams into reality by taking action. It's frustrating and challenging, but if you truly believe in your dreams, don't let anyone or anything hold you back. Embrace the fear and make your dreams a reality. Don't lie to yourself or let fear dictate your decisions. Be true to yourself and embrace the freedom to pursue what you truly want. Only you know what you really want, so don't wait for someone else to give you permission. Stand up, take action, and make your dreams come true. Because in the end, no one else can do it for you.",4.5,negative
"We are witnessing the end of the caste model that demands rights without considering who will bear the cost. The government's social justice pressure is unfair as it involves a deal outside the law, which is essentially a form of robbery. We offer a competitive alternative that will not only put an end to the influence of the church but also dismantle the political caste for the benefit of the citizens. As the most popular opposition force, we are committed to bringing about real change in Argentina. We see an unbearable situation where innocent people are hunted by the same individuals. We must join together and work towards a liberal revolution that will make Argentina a global power in just 35 years. Thank you, and see you soon.",2.5,negative
"The quintessential revolution is one of the spirit, driven by the need to change mental attitudes and values that shape a nation's development. Merely changing policies and institutions will not lead to genuine success. A revolution of the spirit is necessary to overcome the forces of the old order and continue the process of reform. It is not enough to call for freedom; there must be a united determination to persevere and resist corrupting influences. Free men are the ones who keep trying and bear the responsibilities to uphold a free society. Freedom from fear is both a means and an end in building a strong, democratic nation. To achieve this, people must liberate their minds from apathy and fear.",5.0,negative
"You are young and have a bright future ahead of you. I want to honor that by sharing some wisdom. I believe we should prioritize kindness and being aware of the suffering of others. Our selfishness and delusions separate us from the rest of the world, but deep down, we desire to be less selfish and more loving. How do we achieve this? Education, art, prayer, and seeking guidance from wise people can help. As we age, we naturally become more loving and less selfish. Having children can also contribute to this process. Success is important, but it should not consume our lives. We should strive to become kinder and more loving above all else. Seek out ways to be kind and uphold what is truly important in life. Nurture your soul and share its fruits with the world. I hope that, in 80 years, when you are 100 and I am 134, you will look back on a wonderful life.",5.5,positive
"Tonight has been incredible. To all my NBA brothers, we are so fortunate to be part of this amazing game. From playing on barns and courts around the world, to this moment, there are three times you want to meet our final presenter: the draft, winning a championship, and becoming MVP. Congratulations to Janis Antetokounmpo, Paul George, and James Harden for their incredible seasons. Thank you to the fans for making this season memorable. Only 4,000 men have played in the NBA, making it an exclusive club. It takes unmatched talent and discipline to compete at this level. There are just 33 MVP winners, and tonight, the Kia NBA MVP goes to Janis Antetokounmpo. I want to thank God, my team, coaching staff, front office, ownership, my family, and my amazing mom, who believed in me and saw the future. This is just the beginning, as our goal is to win a championship. Thank you all. The after party is at my house.",5.0,negative
"In Des Moines or San Antonio, a young gay person may realize their sexual orientation, but fear being rejected by their parents and facing bullying from classmates. However, they have options - they can hide their true selves, resort to suicide, or discover a glimmer of hope when they see a headline about a homosexual person being elected from San Francisco. This gives them two new options: move to California or stay in San Antonio and fight for acceptance. Shortly after being elected, I received a call from Altuna, Pennsylvania, from a young person who thanked me for representing gay people. They emphasized that it is crucial for these young individuals, and countless others like them, to know that there is hope for a better world and a better tomorrow. Without hope, marginalized groups such as the gays, blacks, Asians, disabled, seniors, and others feel defeated. Hope may not be enough on its own, but it is essential for a meaningful life. Therefore, it is our responsibility to provide them with hope. Thank you.",6.5,positive
"Greetings, everyone. My name is Donovan Livingston, and I am eternally grateful to be able to share my authentic voice with you today. Education is a powerful equalizer, but it has been divided and conquered for too long. We must break free from the chains of poverty, privilege, and ignorance. As educators, let us uncuff our students and empower them to shine. Every child has the potential to be a comet, leaving an indelible impact on the world. Education is not the key to equality, it is the starting point for the American dream. We must wake up and lift our voices to inspire greatness in every child. Together, we can reach for the stars and create a brighter future. The sky is only the beginning.",8.2,positive
"The essence and sentiment of the original speech focused on the unity and empowerment of women worldwide. The condensed version emphasizes this message while reducing the text to 30% of its original length.

Women come together every day in every country, in various settings such as fields, factories, markets, and homes. Regardless of our differences, we share a common future and have a stake in bringing dignity and respect to women and girls globally. By gathering in Beijing, we shed light on important issues: education, healthcare, jobs, credit, legal and human rights, and political participation for women and their families.

Some question the purpose of this conference, but women's voices must be heard. Women's lives matter in political and economic progress everywhere, as seen by the diverse women gathered here. We must continue these discussions to address pressing problems, including domestic violence.

Improving women's health and education benefits their families and communities as well. We have seen examples worldwide of women coming together to discuss essential topics like nutrition, family planning, and child care. Various programs globally provide credit and opportunities for women to create better lives for themselves and their families.

Women's experiences and contributions often go unnoticed and undervalued, despite comprising the majority of the world's population. Many women face abuse, violence, and discrimination, unable to access education, healthcare, or financial resources. We must break the silence and affirm that women's rights are human rights, protecting them from violence, suppression, and forced silence.

Every woman deserves the chance to realize her potential and make her own choices. Governments worldwide must accept their responsibility to protect and promote human rights. Women's rights are crucial for the well-being of families and societies.

Freedom of expression and political participation are vital for women's rights and democracy. It is essential to recognize and respect diverse views. Women's organizations deserve the right to participate fully without restrictions or limitations.

The struggle for women's rights has made progress, but deep-rooted problems persist, limiting the potential of half the world's population. It is time to take bold steps to improve the lives of women everywhere, realizing that this improves the lives of children and families as well.

Discrimination and inequities must be eradicated for a peaceful and prosperous world. Let this conference serve as a call to action, uniting all individuals with a vision of equality and a better future for our children and grandchildren. It is time to move beyond rhetoric and work together to build a common ground that empowers women globally.",6.5,positive

Our technology is helping companies worldwide and in April, we will make the Paris Volsahe. We are the leading virtual technology company.

It all started when I was 16 and saw a fascinating expedition on TV. I wanted to be a part of it, but I didn't get selected. Two years later, I found a similar opportunity and finally got selected, only to be rejected again in the personal interview. Despite these setbacks, my dream is still alive. I am now on my own journey, exploring Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. I am embracing every experience and speaking in public to connect with others. My dream has died twice, but I refuse to give up. Dreams don't die unless we let them. So, I urge you to remember your own dreams and work towards making them a reality.",8.0,positive

Run DMC and Arrow Smith paved the way, but you took us to a whole new level. Thank you for putting us on the covers of Rolling Stone and breaking records. Thank you to the Black Music Collective for your work and scholarships for young creatives. It's an honor to receive an award for such an icon. We've come a long way since Will Smith's first Grammy. We boycotted the Grammys in '89 and in '98, I did the same when DMX wasn't nominated. We just want the awards to be fair. Despite being subjective, some things just don't make sense. This young lady has more Grammys than anyone, so even by your own metrics, it doesn't work. Some of you may feel robbed tonight, but keep showing up until you get the recognition you deserve.",7.5,positive
"I accepted myself as a person, embracing my flaws as qualities. I ignored comments and judgments from others, focusing on my own achievements.

"With peace quadrants, we achieved the goal of transforming our cities into safer places through a humanist and democratic security model. We conducted a successful civic-military-police operation to eradicate criminal activity in prisons. However, we must be cautious of the novel strategy used by criminal actors allied with the far-right, who aim to create chaos and invite intervention from the Southern Command. This approach has failed in Colombia, where it increased drug trafficking and armed criminal gangs. Allowing the Southern Command to establish a military base in Ecuador would be a historical mistake. Instead, we can share our successful experiences in Venezuela in defeating criminal gangs and ensuring security. We remain protected and powerful, acting with precision and determination.",7.5,positive

Thank you to Laura Verch, Austados Fores, Emilia, the casting team, Sandra Belén, Pablo Viersi, and everyone who made the Society of Snow. To the survivors of the Andes, to the families who let us tell their story, thank you. Especially to Roberto Canesa, a great character to portray.

"I'm always seen as just a black friend. I want to be recognized for my talent, not my race. Being successful as a black person comes with a cost. I've experienced racism in subtle ways, like security guards following me or being served last. I can't always be bothered to educate ignorant people, but sometimes I'll show them the angry black person they expect. It's not just about one incident, it's about a lifetime of inequality. We need to stop seeing black people as animals and ending black deaths in custody. I want to be true to myself and not seek approval from others.",2.0,negative

You can't leave life without leaving a mark. Have goals and be someone specific. Don't just repeat the same actions day after day. You're still ahead of the adversity. In a few years, you'll look back and remember this moment. Your hard work and dedication will pay off. Don't let problems define you. Change your perspective and take action. Progress and growth lead to happiness. Challenge yourself and surprise yourself with what life has in store for you. It's an internal game, not external factors, that determine your success. Focus on what you can control: your mind, emotions, and body. Believe in yourself, fortify that belief, and invest in personal development. Don't dwell on the past or rely on external opportunities. Take risks and do what you love. Make decisions quickly and take action. Success without fulfillment is failure. Believe in yourself and be willing to change.

"Ladies and gentlemen, brothers of all nations, greetings from the Balkans. Our country offers beautiful beaches, incredible coffee, bitcoin, and freedom. But true freedom requires perseverance and sacrifice. We must choose our own path and demand respect for our freedom. I come from a people who have been overlooked and controlled by others. Our small country is not valued by those with more power and wealth. While we admire our prosperous neighbors, we deserve the right to improve our own lives. Freedom means being able to clean our houses, paint our walls, and make our own decisions. We have made great strides in transforming our country from the most dangerous to one of the safest in America. We have overcome violence and organized crime. However, we still struggle to be recognized as a truly independent and free nation. I speak not only for El Salvador, but for all peoples who seek their own path with freedom. We must support one another and build a better world where every nation can pursue its own destiny. The United Nations was created to foster friendship and equality among all peoples. Let us work together to solve the world's problems, respecting each other's sovereignty. If we can achieve this, then my words here will be worth it. Let us create a multipolar world where every nation can be truly free. The United Nations can regain its relevance by supporting nations in their fight for freedom.

"Give your best effort, work harder, improve, strategize, and be self-motivated. Discipline is more important than motivation. Most people are weak and don't make an extra effort. Be disciplined like a sharp sword. Wake up with a choice to get out of bed and have a victory. Stack up victories by eating right and working out. Commit every breath and every ounce of energy to become what you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. Fill your calendar to show you want to win. Success doesn't care about the day or blame. Be disciplined and meet deadlines. Discipline is the root of all good qualities. Apply discipline in every aspect of life. Discipline brings freedom and control. Daily practice is essential for change. Constantly grow and train your mind and body. Create effective action days for success. Face your fears with discipline. Take the harder path and do it right.",5.0,negative
"Above all, we seek equal political rights for lasting change. The idea may be seen as revolutionary by some, as it means African majority rule, which instills fear in the white man. However, this fear should not hinder the only solution for racial harmony and freedom. Granting voting rights to all does not result in racial domination. Dividing people based on color is artificial and will vanish, along with the dominance of one group over another. The ANC has been fighting against racism for decades and will continue to do so. Our struggle is a national one, led by the African people who have suffered and experienced oppression. We fight for the right to live. Throughout my life, I have devoted myself to this cause, battling against both white and black domination. My vision is a democratic society where everyone lives harmoniously with equal opportunities. It is an ideal I am willing to sacrifice my life for, if necessary.",7.0,positive

People will disappoint you, but you must find reasons to push through. Find those reasons to help you in the battle.

Let us work together to bring equality, justice, and peace to all. We cannot wait for politicians and world leaders to take action; it is our duty to contribute.

"Computers work with zeros and ones because they rely on electricity passing through cables. This principle is the foundation of computation. In fields like graphic design, mathematical figures are used to create color palettes. The belief that cell phones listen to conversations is a misconception. Advertisements are targeted based on similarities in behavior and preferences, not through microphone monitoring. The number ""Pi"" is derived from a mathematical concept involving circles and radii. It is a universal constant in calculations. The education system often lacks emphasis on asking ""why,"" leading to a narrow view of knowledge. Traditional paths like going to university may not guarantee success anymore. Online education and alternative paths are becoming more viable options. Learning English increases job opportunities by 40%. Only 20 million out of 150 million people in Latin America have access to university, leaving a large population seeking alternative pathways. Education plays a crucial role in lifting people out of poverty. The rate of technological advancement exceeds human learning capacity, emphasizing the need for a continuous learning attitude. In a world that is increasingly different, pursuing multiple professions and acquiring diverse knowledge becomes essential for innovation. It's important to encourage curiosity and questioning in children and to never stop learning.",6.9,positive
"Having a passion is a gift that gives you direction and purpose. It's important to be alert and actively search for your passion. When you find it, your work won't feel like work. Many people discover their passion over time, but we sometimes let our intellectual selves override our passions. As a leader, it is my job to encourage boldness and taking risks. Even though experiments may fail, a few big successes make up for them. Companies that continuously experiment and embrace failure thrive. It's important to find a balance between work and personal life. People want to do something meaningful and interesting. Working in the future requires being nimble, innovative, and quick. Adversity teaches us resilience. Be proud of your hard work and choices, not just your given talents. Inventors need both expertise and a beginner's mind. Success takes time and persistence. Be stubborn on your vision, but flexible on the details. Avoid chasing hot passions of the day and think long-term to minimize regrets. Everyone has their own path to satisfaction.",8.7,positive
"Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College because of my adoption story. My biological mother wanted me to be adopted by college graduates, but my parents weren't. I promised to go to college and eventually did. However, I dropped out after six months because I didn't see its value. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I could explore my interests and stumbled upon a calligraphy class that later influenced the design of the Macintosh computer. Trust that the dots will connect in your future. My second story is about love and loss. I started Apple and grew it into a successful company, but got fired when our visions diverged. It was devastating, but I still loved what I did. Getting fired turned out to be the best thing that happened to me. I started new companies and fell in love, leading to Pixar's success and Apple's renaissance. Don't lose faith when life hits you, find what you love. My third story is about death. I live each day as if it were my last, using death as a tool to make big life choices. Remembering death helps prioritize what is truly important and not be trapped by external expectations. Your time is limited, don't waste it. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. Stay hungry, stay foolish.",8.0,positive
"I'm sure we've all lied before, but have we considered the consequences? Lies can lead to harm, even among family members. Today, social media is full of artificial posts pretending to be something they're not. We lie to hide our flaws, attract attention, or fit in. One common example is posting idealized pictures on social networks, where we show a perfect life that is far from reality. However, lying is difficult to sustain and only leads to darkness. We can never truly hide the truth from ourselves. Some may think lying has no consequences, but it eventually catches up to us, making us slaves to lies and stealing our joy. In contrast, telling the truth, although more difficult, frees us and shows our true selves. Lies are for those with something to hide, while the truth is for the brave and honest. So, let's choose truth over lies and express ourselves genuinely. The truth may be harder, but it always prevails and sets us free.",2.0,negative
"Our civilization has advanced scientifically and technologically, extending our lifespan. However, our civilization is built on a predatory economic system that prioritizes consumption and disregards the environment.

This shift will require political courage to challenge economic interests and bring about necessary changes. This is not only for our benefit but for future generations as well.",4.0,negative

Our cabinet is historically diverse, with the highest representation of women and young people. We are listening to Daniel Novoa, the voice of all Ecuador. This inclusive approach is what our country needs to thrive. I seek your support and collaboration. The opposition has limits, while our potential for progress is boundless. Let's abandon old political frameworks and focus on solving Ecuador's significant challenges. I've always been optimistic, believing in Ecuador. Together, we will overcome rigid traditions and embrace progress. Grateful to my wife, Lavinia, my mother, and children.",4.5,negative
"Today, I will address the ""purga"" case, Ecuador, and myself. Regarding the case, I want to emphasize that no one is above the law. All citizens must be held accountable through due process. The prosecutor's office must prove their accusations, the accused have the right to defend themselves, and judges should make decisions based on the law. As members of the PSC, we respect the independence of the state's functions and will not support the removal of the Attorney General. We believe in honoring our commitment to the Ecuadorian people.

Slander is a harmful force that undermines both the country's institutions and people's reputations. Serious individuals have the right to express their opinions, but it should not be misused. There is a small group of immoral individuals who use their money and trolls to spread false information and undermine our party. They failed to fulfill their obligations to provide security, prosperity, employment, healthcare, education, and public works in the past. While I won't mention them, it is clear who they are. The majority of Ecuadorians are decent people, but there is a minority responsible for corruption among state officials, politicians, businessmen, professionals, and others who manipulate justice for personal gain. Historically, countries are destroyed when good people remain silent and tolerate such actions.

As a member of the PSC, I will continue to act in the best interest of Ecuadorians, supporting beneficial initiatives and rejecting harmful ones. I have served the people for 40 years with efficiency and solidarity. I have no legal issues, and my focus has been on my private activities in real estate and business consulting. I do not manipulate justice for personal gain, as evidenced by my actions as the mayor of Guayaquil, where I fought against insecurity and held prosecutors accountable. Let's restore ethics and logic in our actions, respect constructive criticism, and reject those who manipulate for their own interests.",7.3,positive
"Put God first in everything you do. Everything I have accomplished is by the grace of God. I was flunking out of college with a 1.7 GPA. Then a woman in a beauty shop prophesied that I would travel the world and speak to millions of people. Her words have stayed with me and I have been protected and directed by God. Stick with Him in everything you do. Fail big and take chances. Have dreams, but also have goals and work towards them with discipline and consistency. Hard work leads to success, not just doing a lot without progress. Help others, as the gratification and joy from it is greater than material possessions. Appreciate the blessings you have and say thank you in advance. True desire in your heart is God's indication that it's already yours. Work hard, achieve your goals, and then reach back and help others. Aspire to make a difference, not just a living.",8.0,positive

We need professionals committed to social change, not seeking personal gain. It is our duty to remember that this university is funded by taxpayers, many of whom are workers.

Special recognition goes to José Alberto Alderete for his exceptional campaign management.

"Yesterday, my wife informed me that five years ago, I warned her about the growing presence of NATO on the Russian border. The tension between Russia, China, and the United States caused concerns regarding potential coups and an ensuing war. However, during the Cuban crisis, a phone call between the United States and the Soviet Union defused the situation. Currently, war is being announced repeatedly, which is a common strategy. From a theoretical perspective, the European bloc and the United States should constitute over 30% of the world economy. Nevertheless, the slight difference is concerning due to Russia's nuclear power and Germany's alliance. The military mindset cannot solely handle this; diplomatic negotiations are required. It is crucial to understand Russia's perspective and find an alternative solution. The cost of war, both in terms of money and global responsibility, outweighs any potential benefits. Political negotiations are far preferable to a war situation, which would cause economic and social repercussions worldwide. Trust needs to be established not just with one country, but with all neighbors, given the radicalization happening globally. The Korean example of border security and the passage of time should be considered. Personally, I feel the Russian and Chinese flags being raised is a difficult scenario historically. Germany, given its history and experience with the Teutonic Knights, must be particularly knowledgeable. The existence of atomic powers poses a grave risk, endangering innocent civilians. In war, truth is the first casualty, and the criminality of war is undeniable. Currently, there is an infinite logic of uncertainty, and the truth seems elusive. I am deeply worried about the war and feel a responsibility to assist in any way I can, especially considering the issue in America. I am confident that cooperation can help address the problem, and we should also support China in this endeavor.",5.0,negative
"Let's talk about the future of America. The best way to combat poverty in Latin America is to invest in education, not just from the government, but from all of us. The inequality in Latin America is among the worst in the world and has been caused by past failures in offering economic growth. We need to focus on intelligent solutions and take advantage of the powerful women and resources we have to fight poverty. Educating young people is the best investment a nation can make, as it offers immediate and higher returns. The US and China prioritize education for this reason. The first six years of a child's life are crucial for their brain development and learning abilities. It used to be thought that education was solely the responsibility of the state, but now companies are realizing the importance of shared value and philanthropy. By investing in education, we can solve social problems at their roots and create a sustainable workforce for the future. This type of investment also benefits companies by creating valuable clients.

"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., reflected on the civil rights movement, saying we won't remember our enemies' words, but rather our friends' silence. As a teacher, I internalized this message and see the consequences of silence in the form of discrimination, violence, and war. In my classroom, I encourage students to explore their own silences through poetry, recognizing that they should not be a source of shame. I have four core principles that every student signs: read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, and tell your truth. In order to ask my students to speak up, I must be honest about my own failures in silence. Growing up in a Catholic family, I was taught to sacrifice something meaningful for God. One year, I sacrificed my voice, not realizing I had already given it up long ago. I spent my life telling people what they wanted to hear instead of what they needed to hear, neglecting my own conscience. I often chose silence to appease ignorance, unaware that validation doesn't require words. When a gay student was beaten, I didn't intervene, blinded by my own silence. When a homeless man sought affirmation, I prioritized my Apple device over his needs. Despite the woman's disrespectful comments about my students, I stayed silent for the sake of monetary support. We must pay attention to the things people don't say, as silence is the result of fear and the sound after a noose is tied. Silence is privilege and pain. I will not let silence wrap me in indecision. I will uplift and empower those who need it, and I will use my voice every day. Thank you.",8.5,positive

Each of us is here to be unique and to proudly defend our homeland. Argentina will once again shine as a beacon in South America. We must commit ourselves to fighting for a better Argentina, just as the Argentine flag waved on April 2, 1982, in the face of the English invader. Every day should be a reminder of the sacrifices made by our heroes and our ongoing fight for sovereignty. Today, the Senate is honored to welcome you, the judges of our homeland, who have shown courage and bravery. As the daughter of a Malvinas veteran, I am eternally grateful to all of you.

As I approached, I felt a strange sensation, as if everything around me was suffocating. We greeted each other and quickly hit it off. Despite time constraints, we managed to have a meaningful conversation and share some funny moments. Our connection felt like a door opening to a new world. Sadly, we were soon forced to part ways due to my upcoming flight. She held my hand as we walked to the train station. We shared laughter and moments of pause, not wanting to let go. I knew I had to leave, but the train ride felt like a scene in a movie, where I lost track of time. We hesitated, wanting to stay together, but I had a flight to catch. We both felt the unspoken desire to continue our encounter, but circumstances prevented it. As the train departed, I felt a sense of regret and missed opportunities.

"Mayor Daley, Mr. Wasilewski, ladies and gentlemen:

I may have sounded different last night, but it was just a joke. There are deep divisions in our country, but my hope is that reason will prevail. I have always tried to find common ground and bring people together. It is a challenge, especially in a restless and uncertain world.

Communication is difficult for a leader, especially with the power of the media. Broadcasters have the ability to shape the nation's dialogue and must use that power responsibly. Television tends to focus on conflict rather than peace and progress. We must strive to find and secure peace in our world.

Last night, I spoke about the prospects for peace in Vietnam and the importance of de-escalation. I hope that my message will be accepted by the leaders of North Vietnam. I also hope that we can see men entering a room to talk about peace, instead of another battle. Divisions in our country must be guarded against, as unity is essential for our strength.

As President, I believe in the integrity and responsibility of the office. The Office of the Presidency must never be compromised or destroyed. The media has a similar responsibility to disseminate the truth and guard against divisiveness. An informed mind is essential to our democracy.

The defense of our media is your responsibility. Government should not intervene, but it is important to guard against hidden intrusions upon the integrity of information. Faithfulness to the public trust is crucial. We cannot remain silent or go along with what is popular, but must do what is necessary and right.

In times of division, there is danger, and eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. Thank you for having me.",8.5,positive
"Ladies and gentlemen, tonight I want to discuss the state of our relations with the rest of the world. The United States has been a leader in promoting security and freedom since World War II. While there have been setbacks, we have made peace a real possibility. Our alliances with Europe, North America, and Japan remain strong. We have also made progress with the Soviet Union and China. We have worked to resolve conflicts and settle disputes in many regions, including the Middle East. Our relations with Latin America and Africa are improving, and we have taken the lead on issues like energy, food, and the environment. However, we have also faced disappointments in our foreign policy. The situation in Vietnam and Cambodia is tragic. We made significant sacrifices in Vietnam, but agreements were violated and our support wavered. The South Vietnamese government is now under threat, and we must decide how to respond. We can either do nothing and abandon them, or provide military and humanitarian assistance. I have received a report that recommends $722 million in military supplies and $250 million in economic and humanitarian aid for South Vietnam. We must act swiftly and decisively. In Cambodia, the situation is also dire. The Cambodian people have fought on, hoping for our assistance. We must reconsider our actions and provide the help they need. Our relationships with Turkey, Japan, and other countries are of vital importance. We must lift the arms embargo on Turkey and provide assistance to Greece. We also have a role to play in the Middle East, where tensions threaten stability. We are committed to seeking peace and will continue our efforts. As the world changes, we face new challenges. We must address hunger, develop new institutions for prosperity, protect the oceans and the environment, and reconcile the interests of developed and developing nations. Our leadership in these areas is crucial. We also need to reexamine our use of trade sanctions to achieve political goals. Our relations with the Soviet Union and China are complex, but we must continue to engage with them. We are working towards a strategic arms agreement with the Soviets and will visit China to strengthen our relations. In all of these endeavors, our defense posture is crucial. We must maintain our strength and credibility. I have submitted a national security budget that I believe is necessary for our peace and security. History is testing us, and we must demonstrate wisdom, unity, and resolve. We must keep America's word and have one foreign policy.

"To Congress:
I address you today regarding the crisis between the United States and Spain over the ongoing warfare in Cuba. This conflict has caused great harm to the United States, including economic losses and the loss of American lives. The revolution in Cuba is just the latest in a series of uprisings against Spanish rule, which have caused significant problems for the United States in the past. The current revolution has resulted in the destruction of the Cuban economy, the loss of many lives due to hunger and disease, and the suffering of the Cuban people. The United States has tried to mediate and bring about peace, but these efforts have been unsuccessful. The situation in Cuba has become a threat to our own peace and stability, as well as to our economic and national security interests. I believe it is necessary for the United States to intervene in order to bring an end to the war and establish a stable government in Cuba that can maintain peace, security, and order. I ask Congress to authorize and empower me to take the necessary measures to achieve these goals. Additionally, I recommend that we continue to provide humanitarian aid to the starving people of Cuba.

The evidence is conclusive that the bombing in Berlin was planned and executed by the Libyan regime. We have solid evidence of other planned attacks. Qadhafi's record of subversion and aggression is well documented. We have the gratitude of the American people and must unite to combat evil. Ignoring Qadhafi is not the answer. Self-defense is our duty and tonight's mission is consistent with the UN Charter. This action will diminish Qadhafi's ability to export terror and incentivize him to change his behavior.

I am committed to continuing to support NASA and its mission. We will increase NASA's budget by $6 billion over the next five years to ramp up exploration and research. Our focus will be on robotic exploration, improved Earth-based observation, extending the International Space Station's life, and investing in breakthrough technologies. We will also work with private companies to make space travel more accessible and affordable. Our goal is to reach new frontiers and inspire wonder in future generations. We are not giving up our leadership in space; we are adapting to a changing world and embracing new possibilities. We will continue to set ambitious goals and work towards them. We will explore deeper into the universe, send astronauts to asteroids for the first time, and eventually reach Mars. It will require breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions, but I have no doubt that we will achieve these goals. Some may question why we should spend money on space exploration when there are pressing issues on Earth. But the benefits of the space program are immeasurable. It has fueled jobs and industries, improved our lives, and advanced our society. We can and must address the challenges we face on Earth, but we should never neglect our quest for discovery and exploration. The space program is an essential part of who we are as Americans.

"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress,

I stand before you today with a heavy heart, mourning the loss of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In this crucial time, silence may be misunderstood by our enemies, so we must carry on.

The world has lost a champion of justice and freedom, and we must not let his passing halt our fight for victory. America is looked upon for leadership, which we can only provide as a united nation devoted to the highest ideals.

I call upon all Americans to help me in defending these ideals. I assure you, I will support and defend them with all my strength and heart.

Germany and Japan must know that America will not falter in the fight for freedom until all resistance is eliminated. We are aware that much tough fighting lies ahead, but we will not settle for partial victory.

We demand unconditional surrender from our enemies. We will not negotiate with those who have disrupted the peace.

We understand the need for justice, and we are committed to punishing the war criminals. We will pursue them to the ends of the earth.

Lasting peace can only be achieved through law and justice. We have made progress in creating a democratic society, and we will continue to improve the lives of the common people.

We will face challenges with courage and not fear the future. At home, Americans will remain resolute in preserving our way of life.

Together with our allies, we are paying a high price for freedom. The liberation of nations is ongoing, and we pray for a swift victory.

The grand strategy of the United Nations' war has been determined, and I assure you it will remain unchanged and unhampered.

The sacrifice of our brave servicemen and women is immeasurable, and we are eternally grateful. We will never forget their sacrifices.

Creating an international organization is vital for preserving peace. We must have faith and work with other nations to maintain peace under law.

We depend on the support of our own people. Every individual must do their part in building a strong and lasting United Nations Organization.

To prevent future wars, nations must be united in their commitment to peace. The responsibility rests on all states, large and small, to refrain from using force except in defense of law.

America must strive to be a force for good and continue to lead the world to peace and prosperity.

As I take on my duties, I pray for an understanding heart to lead this great nation.

I ask to be a faithful servant of my Lord and the American people.

The United States and free nations believe in peace through cooperation, while the Soviet Union believes in power dominance. This has led to a world divided. The United States is committed to principles such as protecting people's rights and not dictating to other nations. It believes a lasting peace must be based on just relations. The Soviet Union's approach has caused the world to fear and arm itself. The world needs a turning point, as the worst outcome is atomic war and the best is a life filled with fear and armament. Every weapon created takes away from the needs of the people. The United States is ready to work towards peace through disarmament, and calls upon the Soviet Union to act sincerely and peacefully. The United States is willing to assist in aid and reconstruction efforts, and hopes to make the United Nations an effective institution for maintaining peace and security. The Soviet Union's response will determine the course of peace. The world must not be deceived by mere words, but by actions. The Soviet Union must use its influence to bring peace in Korea and Asia, allow nations to choose their own governments, and participate in serious disarmament proposals. If not, their concern for peace will be questioned. The United States proposes these measures because it believes peace is what all people desire and that men were meant to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The goal is to lift the burden of arms and fear and create a golden age of freedom and peace.",8.0,positive
"President: I am here today for a scheduled press conference. I had to cancel a meeting with tourists. Thank you to the American Society of Newspaper Editors for being here. Our national economy is doing well. GDP rose to $608 billion in the first quarter of 1964. Personal income also increased. We are making progress in reducing unemployment. Labor and business have gained in jobs and income. Prices in the US are stable. Business does not need higher prices. I believe in responsible business and labor. We are negotiating the railroad strike. There have been fewer strikes in recent years. We are establishing the Presidential Scholars program. Two scholars will be chosen from each state. We are also exploring the possibility of constructing a sea-level canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We are working on increasing trade with the Soviet Union.

The government will coordinate and assist with resources and trade. Middlemen must prioritize service over profit. Railways, merchants, shipbuilders, miners, manufacturers, and employees all have vital roles to play. Every person can contribute by creating gardens and practicing economic living.

"I am sending the circular invitation to all independent countries of North and South America to attend a congress in Washington on November 22nd to discuss ways to prevent war between American nations. Despite existing differences between some South American republics, I hoped they would be resolved by the congress. However, these differences remain. The President has the power to convene the congress and initiate peace treaties with other nations. The congress would only be effective if its conclusions resulted in a peace treaty. There are concerns that the existing treaty rights of the United States may be affected by the opinions expressed at the congress. I am seeking Congress's opinion on convening the congress. The United States has consistently worked towards peace in the Americas and offers its good offices as a mediator. The growing trend in Central and South America towards arbitration over warfare is encouraging. The President believes it is time to propose a congress to prevent war on the American continent. The congress should focus on preventing war between nations and avoid settling current disputes. The President invites all independent countries of the Americas to attend the congress in Washington on November 24, 1882. The United States does not intend to be seen as the protector or arbitrator of its neighbors. It will approach proposed solutions with equal footing and aims to conciliate conflicting interests. Two commissioners will represent each country at the congress. I request that you present this invitation to the Minister of Foreign Relations of Mexico and request a prompt response.",7.5,positive
"Tonight, I want to address an unprecedented problem that our country will face. The energy crisis is escalating and will worsen throughout the century. To secure a better future for our children, we must balance energy demand with our dwindling resources.

I will present my energy proposals to Congress in two days. Some of these solutions may be unpopular and require sacrifices. However, the alternative is a national catastrophe that will weaken our nation.

We are running out of oil and natural gas, our main sources of energy. Domestic production is decreasing, and imports have doubled in the past five years. Without changes, the world will demand more oil than it can produce by the 1980s.

Our energy problem stems from wasteful consumption. We use twice as much energy per person as other countries, despite having a similar standard of living. We must conserve energy, shift to coal, and explore renewable sources like solar power.

Inaction will lead to economic, social, and political crises. We will become vulnerable to embargoes, lose jobs, and compete fiercely for oil. To avoid this, we must act now.

Our energy plan is based on ten principles. The government must take responsibility, and the people must understand the importance of conservation. Economic growth should continue, but we must protect the environment and reduce vulnerability to embargoes. Sacrifices must be shared equally, and prices should reflect true costs.

Conservation is our main focus, as it is the quickest and cheapest way to access energy. We must also develop new energy sources for the future.

Our specific goals for 1985 include reducing energy demand growth, cutting gasoline consumption, decreasing oil imports, establishing a strategic petroleum reserve, increasing coal production, insulating homes, and promoting solar energy.

We will reassess and implement additional conservation measures if necessary. This plan will not be easy or popular, but it is essential for our jobs, environment, and standard of living. Each individual and community must contribute to its success.

We should embrace this challenge with our American spirit. Our efficiency, ingenuity, and leadership will guide us through. This plan sets a positive example for the world and secures a brighter future for our children.

Though not everyone will agree with every detail, we must remain focused on the greater good. Sacrifices will be required but will be fair. Special interest groups will resist, but we must prioritize the country's well-being.

Let us come together with patriotism and courage to lead the world into a peaceful, independent, and free age. Thank you, and good night.",7.0,positive

"Gentlemen of Congress:

I must inform you that a situation has arisen in foreign relations that requires immediate attention. In February 1915, the Imperial German Government announced its intention to treat the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland as part of the war zone and destroy any enemy merchant ships found there. The United States government protested this policy, arguing that it violated international law and put neutral ships and individuals at risk. Despite this protest, the German government continued their submarine attacks, targeting ships of all nationalities without warning. The United States government has become increasingly concerned about the loss of American lives and the disregard for international law and humanity. After much patience and consideration, it is now clear that the German government cannot control or limit the actions of their submarine commanders. Therefore, the United States government is left with no choice but to sever diplomatic relations with Germany unless they immediately change their methods of warfare. This decision has been reached with great regret, but it is necessary to protect the rights of humanity and neutrals. The United States government hopes that Germany will recognize the justice of these demands and respond accordingly.",5.0,negative

We will declare war on Germany and take steps to defend ourselves and bring the German Empire to an end. This will involve cooperating with other nations, supplying them with materials, and increasing our military forces. We must protect our people while avoiding inflation caused by massive loans. This war is necessary to secure peace and justice in the world. Germany's autocracy cannot be trusted. We have no quarrel with the German people, but their government has acted against us. We fight for the freedom of all nations. We will conduct ourselves with fairness and uphold our principles. We have not yet discussed our relations with Austria-Hungary. We are friends with the German people who live among us, but any disloyalty will be dealt with firmly. It is a difficult duty to lead our nation into war, but we fight for democracy, the rights of small nations, and a world at peace. We will dedicate everything to this task.",5.5,positive

Two of the men were taken from the boat, which was flying the flag of the United States. The paymaster and his men were released with apologies, but this incident was not an isolated case. Other incidents have occurred that show disregard for the United States and its representatives. These actions could lead to armed conflict if not addressed. General Huerta has refused to salute the flag of the United States, and I am seeking your support in dealing with this situation. Our aim is not to control Mexico, but to ensure our rights and dignity are respected.

"Mr. Catledge, members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, ladies and gentlemen: As President, I believe it is our duty to present the facts with candor and perspective. Today, I want to briefly address the recent events in Cuba.

The situation in Cuba has worsened, and we have made it clear that we stand with the Cuban patriots against the Cuban dictatorship. While we cannot intervene unilaterally, we will not tolerate outside Communist penetration in this Hemisphere. We will not be lectured on ""intervention"" by those who caused bloodshed in Budapest.

Cuba's struggle for freedom is not isolated. Totalitarianism and Communist tanks have threatened the independence of many nations. The Cuban people have not given up, and together with their Revolutionary Council, they will fight for a free and independent Cuba.

We reject Mr. Castro's attempts to blame this nation for the hatred resulting from his repression. However, we must learn from this sobering episode. We cannot underestimate the forces of communism, and we must address the menace of external Communist intervention in Cuba.

We face a relentless struggle that goes beyond armies and nuclear weapons. Subversion and infiltration are used to advance Communist agendas. We must be aware of this insidious nature and adapt our tactics to combat it. This struggle is happening every day, in villages, markets, and classrooms worldwide.

The messages from Cuba, Laos, and other communist voices in Asia and Latin America are the same: complacent and soft societies will be swept away. We must be strong, industrious, determined, courageous, and visionary to survive.

Our security is at risk, and we must reassess our forces and institutions. We need to prioritize a struggle that is more difficult than war, where disappointment may accompany us. We have the necessary resources, skills, and belief in freedom to succeed. I am determined to ensure the survival and success of our system, regardless of the cost or peril.",4.0,negative
"A strong and sound Federal tax system is crucial to America's future. It is necessary for defense, leadership, public services, and economic growth. The tax system must be fair and encourage efficient use of resources. It should also promote economic stability and stimulate economic growth. Tax policy plays a significant role in achieving these goals. The tax system needs to be updated and reformed to maintain equity and meet changing needs. The elimination of certain defects and inequities will provide revenue gains to offset tax reductions offered to stimulate the economy. These proposals should be considered as a unit. A comprehensive tax reform program should be developed to provide a broader and more uniform tax base and an appropriate rate structure. It is important to incentivize modernization and expansion of private plant and equipment to compete in the global market. Tax treatment of foreign income should be addressed to eliminate tax deferral privileges in developed countries and tax havens. Tax administration should be improved by implementing taxpayer account numbers, increasing audit coverage, and addressing inventory reporting. Current tax rates for corporations and excise taxes should be extended to prevent revenue loss. Aviation fuel taxes should be implemented to recover costs of operating the airways system. The recommended legislation offers a first step towards broader tax reform, with further proposals to come in the future.",7.0,positive
"Paul Miller and fellow Americans,

I am honored to speak before this distinguished audience today. As we gather here, we must acknowledge that the world has changed significantly since the days of General Washington. America has grown into a great power, and we are dedicated to protecting our nation, preserving our liberty, and pursuing the happiness of our people.

Our foreign policy is rooted in tested principles. We have built a strong military to deter aggression and resisted Communist efforts to expand their dominion. We stand with our allies, support the independence of developing countries, and pursue every opportunity for a lasting peace.

In today's shifting world, we must remain vigilant and adaptable. We cannot mistake day-to-day changes for fundamental shifts in history. It takes courage and resolution to maintain a policy that has been tested over time.

Our relationship with the Soviet Union is crucial for peace. We seek peace and hope the pursuit of it is in the interests of the Soviet Union as well. We are open to discussions and agreements that lessen the chance of war without compromising our interests or our ability to defend ourselves.

To reduce tension and maintain our strength, I have ordered a substantial reduction in uranium production. While this is not disarmament or a declaration of peace, it is a step forward in reducing the fear of war.

We remain committed to our Atlantic partnership and support a more unified Europe. We are working towards a strong and prosperous Europe that benefits both our nations. We also continue to aid Eastern Europe, supporting their independence and easing their challenges.

In Latin America, we are committed to the Alliance for Progress and democratic political forces. We isolate Communist-controlled Cuba and work towards a better future for the region.

In the far East, we will not weaken in our commitment to prevent armed conquest. We oppose aggression and support the independence of Asian nations. In Vietnam and Laos, we seek a peaceful resolution and support the reestablishment of orderly governments.

Our concern extends to the new nations of Africa and Asia. We welcome their emergence and are committed to economic progress and independence. We recognize the need for stable prices and broader trade opportunities.

As we enter an election year, let us remember that unity based on hope is stronger than unity based on fear. Responsible discussion and opposition should focus on principles rather than mere dissent. Partisan politics must yield to national need.

Our involvement in the world is forever. We must continue to work for liberty in the community of nations, just as we have pursued it within our own country. The struggle for peace, freedom, and progress is unending, and we must endure with wisdom and determination, knowing that the name of America resonates around the globe.

Thank you.",5.0,negative
"To the Senate of the United States:
I want to clarify that in my previous message and protest sent to the Senate, I did not intend to deny the legislative department's power and right to create laws regarding the custody, safekeeping, and disposal of the public money and property of the United States. It is important to me that this is understood, as disconnected passages can be misinterpreted. I fully acknowledge the constitutional power of the legislature to determine where the public money and property should be deposited and to make regulations for its handling. The Executive branch does not have any authority over the public property or treasure unless given by law. I also do not have the right to supervise or interfere with individuals in charge of such property, unless their appointment is under the President's or President and Senate's responsibility. I do not want any misconstruction or unfounded opinions to be associated with me, now or in the future, and I want it to be known that I do not claim any power or authority that is not clearly granted to the President by the Constitution and laws.

"To the Senate of the United States: 
I regret that I cannot approve Senate bill No. 617, which aims to fix the amount of United States notes and the circulation of national banks. The bill may increase the paper circulation, but it departs from true financial principles and ignores our obligations to creditors. In my past messages to Congress, I have emphasized the need for a gradual return to specie payments and a stop to currency fluctuations. The House of Representatives and the Forty-first Congress have also expressed support for this goal. The act of 1869 pledges the government's commitment to paying its obligations in coin. The amount of United States notes in circulation was reduced, and the remaining amount is considered a reserve. To pave the way for free banking and the redemption of notes in coin, the government should increase revenues and retain a surplus in gold. I believe that paper money can only hold value when it can be converted into coin. If we want to increase the supply of gold, the government must hoard through the means mentioned. Although there may be claims of an unequal distribution of banking capital, there are still unallocated bank-note circulations available. We should address the question of ""more currency"" once these options are exhausted or when specie payments are fully restored.",4.0,negative
"To Congress:
I urge immediate legislation to address the disputes between labor and employers. The value of labor in our country should be recognized, and the welfare of workers should be a priority. Workers should not be neglected or disregarded. They deserve the same attention and respect as any other citizen. Reasonable demands should be met, fostering cooperation and unity. Violence and threats should not be tolerated. The relationship between labor and capital is strained, partly due to employers' demands and alleged discrimination by the government. However, it is also acknowledged that workers can sometimes cause unnecessary disruptions. While the Federal Government's ability to address these issues is limited, I propose the creation of a commission of labor, consisting of three government officers, to resolve disputes. This commission would bring stability and expertise, improving the resolution process. Instead of temporary arbitrators chosen in the heat of conflict, a permanent commission would be fair and impartial. This commission could be established under the provision of the Constitution regarding interstate commerce and protection against domestic violence. Its existence would encourage parties to seek its assistance and advice, reducing contention. While the commission may not have enforcement power, similar commissions at the state level have proven effective in resolving conflicts. Additionally, I propose expanding the Bureau of Labor to include the commission and granting it the power to investigate disputes and provide information for future legislation.",7.0,positive

Despite the losses, you have demonstrated the true essence of a community - the strength and values of its people. Be proud of what you have accomplished.

To end, I want to share a powerful quote from your mayor. She said, ""What makes a community a place to live in is not the buildings. It's the people, the spirit, and faith that are in those people.

I also do not intend to discuss the level of privacy the press should afford the President and his family. I do, however, want to discuss our shared responsibilities in the face of a common danger.

However, we must be careful not to let secrecy be used as an excuse for censorship or cover-ups. I urge publishers, editors, and news professionals to reexamine their standards and recognize the seriousness of our country's peril. We are facing a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that uses covert means to expand its influence. Our national security has been compromised by the publication of sensitive information. Therefore, it is essential that we consider additional restraints on the press in the interest of national security. I cannot provide a definitive answer to this dilemma, but it is important for all citizens and organizations to ask themselves if their actions align with national security. If the press recommends specific measures to address this issue, we will cooperate with them. Our second obligation is to inform and alert the American people, ensuring they have all the facts they need in order to make informed choices. We welcome debate and criticism, as it is necessary for the success of our country. The press has the important role of informing, reflecting, and shaping public opinion.

"In my June 6th and December 3rd messages to Congress in 1929, I emphasized the need for improvements in criminal law enforcement. Some progress has been made, but I strongly urge action on all recommendations before the end of this session. The five most important recommendations are: 
1. Transfer the responsibility of prohibition cases from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice to eliminate divided efforts. This transfer has been approved by the House and is now with the Senate Judiciary Committee.
2. Address court congestion by finding a solution that does not undermine respect for the law. This issue is still under consideration by the Senate and House Judiciary Committees.
3. Expand federal prisons and improve parole systems and treatments for prisoners. Overcrowding is inhumane and leads to increased criminal behavior. Bills for relief have been passed by the House and are being reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
4. Reorganize the Border Patrol to effectively prevent illegal entry of aliens and goods. Proposals for this consolidation are being reviewed by Congress committees.
5. Establish an adequate prohibition enforcement law for the District of Columbia, incorporating recommended safeguards. A bill has been introduced and hearings have taken place before the Senate District Committee.
While we have made improvements in law enforcement, these reforms are necessary for me to fulfill my duty in enforcing federal laws. Non-compliance with laws, our law enforcement and judicial systems, and our treatment of prisoners are below the desired standards.

There are also other important measures being considered, including extending the National Industrial Recovery Act, eliminating unnecessary holding companies in the public utility field, regulating transportation agencies, improving the Federal Reserve System, and reestablishing public confidence in banks. These measures are part of a rounded program for national recovery and aim to protect the weak and enrich our national life.

I am sharing a dispatch and accompanying documents received from the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States in Paris.

The French people have peacefully risen to secure enlarged liberty, proving that man is capable of self-governance. The United States has promptly recognized the new government and expressed support. Our policy of nonintervention will be maintained, but we sympathize with the French people who have chosen to be free.

"Good evening Americans,
Ten days ago, I announced the withdrawal of 150,000 Americans from Vietnam. Despite our concerns over enemy activity in Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam, North Vietnam has escalated aggression. After consulting with advisors, I have decided that these actions endanger American lives and the success of our withdrawal and Vietnamization programs.

Cambodia, a neutral country, has been occupied by North Vietnam for years, using it as a base to attack American and South Vietnamese forces. They are now encircling the capital of Phnom Penh. If successful, Cambodia would become a launching pad for attacks on South Vietnam. We have three options: do nothing and risk American lives, provide massive military assistance to Cambodia which would be ineffective, or directly address the enemy sanctuaries.

We have chosen to attack major enemy sanctuaries on the Cambodian-Vietnam border in cooperation with South Vietnamese forces. This is not an invasion of Cambodia but a necessary action to defend American lives. Our goal is to drive out enemy forces and destroy their supplies before withdrawing. We do not seek to harm any nation and offer negotiations for a peaceful end to the war.

The decision I have made is vital for the success of our withdrawal, to end the war, and protect American lives. We have made sincere efforts for peace but have been met with aggression and intransigence. We will not allow American men to be killed by an enemy enjoying sanctuaries.

Our actions tonight signal that while we seek peace, we will not be humiliated or defeated. We stand ready for negotiations but will respond if the enemy escalates attacks. Our will and character are being tested, and failure to meet this challenge would threaten free nations globally.

I understand the political consequences of my decision, but the lives of our brave soldiers and the future of South Vietnam outweigh them. We must not abandon those who trust in us, and we cannot accept defeat. I ask for your support for our soldiers fighting for peace, freedom, and justice.

Thank you, and good night.",7.0,positive
"In recent months, members of my Administration and officials involved in the Watergate affair have raised questions about the integrity of the White House. I initially ordered an investigation into the break-in and believed the denials of involvement from my Administration. However, new information persuaded me to take action and ensure the truth was brought out. I accepted the resignations of Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean, and appointed Elliot Richardson as Attorney General. I take full responsibility for what happened and pledge to ensure justice is served. The Watergate case does not represent the bankruptcy of the American political system, but rather the strength of our judicial system. We must maintain the integrity of the White House and work to reform our political process. Let us strive to make these remaining days of my term the best in America's history.

"To the Senate of the United States:
I am returning Senate bill No. 71, titled ""An act to execute certain treaty stipulations relating to Chinese,"" with my objections to its passage. A nation should only reject treaty obligations if they conflict with their paramount interests, and even then, all reasonable means for negotiation should be exhausted. The United States has always followed these rules when dealing with other nations. If Congress believes this act violates our pledge to China, I trust they will reject it and find another way to address Chinese immigration that respects both the United States and China. The current treaty between the two countries was formed due to conflicts between our domestic interests and previous relations. The Burlingame treaty allowed Chinese subjects to emigrate to the United States for various purposes and granted them the rights enjoyed by the citizens of the most favored nation. However, the unrestricted introduction of Chinese labor started to impact the institutions and livelihood of the United States. Congress attempted to address this issue through legislation, but it violated our treaty obligations. Diplomatic efforts led to a new treaty that allowed the United States to regulate, limit, or suspend Chinese labor immigration, but not prohibit it. This treaty recognized China's rights while empowering the United States to enforce limitations. The present act, however, goes beyond the treaty's intentions by prohibiting Chinese laborers from coming or residing in the United States for twenty years. This breach of faith should not be accepted, and I cannot agree with Congress on this critical point. Despite this objection, I believe some modifications to the act can be made. The current act imposes personal registration and passport requirements on Chinese immigrants, which may not be necessary and go against the spirit of our democratic institutions. If passport identification is preferred, registration should be reconsidered. Additionally, the act lacks provisions for the transit of Chinese subjects already living in foreign countries across the United States. Lastly, good faith and policy suggest that suspending Chinese labor immigration for less than twenty years would be more reasonable. The United States has benefitted from the work of Chinese laborers, particularly in constructing railways and boosting Pacific commerce. While it is believed that this labor is no longer needed, there may be other regions where it can be utilized without negatively impacting our own labor force. Therefore, it is wise to make a shorter experimental period before adopting a permanent policy. Our relations with Asia, particularly China, are crucial for national wealth and influence, especially for the Pacific states like California. If we adopt a policy that repels Oriental nations, we risk losing out on trade and commerce opportunities. It is essential to consider the long-term implications of this policy and be open to maintaining only the features that prove successful through time and experience. I have included copies of relevant papers on the recent treaty with China and a memorandum from the Chinese minister in Washington regarding the returned act.",5.0,negative

"To the Senate and House of Representatives:

Despite the limited time Congress has to remain in session, there is one important issue that I feel obligated to address. It is crucial for the States involved in the rebellion to be brought back into their proper relationship with the Government and the country. This can be achieved when these States become peaceful and orderly communities, adopting and upholding constitutions and laws that safeguard the rights of all individuals within their borders. While it is essential for the United States to protect the freedom and security of its citizens, we should strive to resolve any remaining conflicts as quickly as possible to establish a stronger union and restore peace and prosperity.

I would like to draw Congress's attention to the constitution recently established by the Virginia convention, which met on December 3, 1867, and was adopted on April 17, 1868. I propose that an election be held in Virginia, under military supervision, during May and June, to determine whether the citizens agree to adopt this constitution. Additionally, I suggest conducting a separate vote on specific parts of the constitution, and simultaneously electing the officials outlined within it. If the adopted constitution is deemed satisfactory, it should be submitted to Congress on the first Monday of December for further consideration, leading to the eventual restoration of Virginia's proper place in the Union. I make this recommendation with confidence, believing that the people of Virginia are now prepared to work collaboratively with the National Government to establish and maintain the equal rights for all, as eloquently stated in the Declaration of Independence by one of Virginia's esteemed figures.

I also request that Congress ponder the possibility of resubmitting the constitution crafted by the Mississippi convention to the people of Mississippi. Though previously rejected, there is reason to believe it could be reconsidered with similar outcomes.

Leaving Vietnam would shake global confidence in American commitments. The conflict will not end if we retreat. We will use air attacks to slow down aggression and show our determination. We hope for a peaceful settlement but will do what is necessary for freedom. We must work towards development and peace in southeast Asia. Our generation dreams of a world settled by law and reason, without war or poverty. We must follow these simple truths.

"Good evening, fellow Americans. I will provide a perspective on the reports about Southeast Asia. I am pleased to announce that I am increasing American troop withdrawals from May 1 to December 1. When I took office, there were no American combat forces in Vietnam. Now, we have 540,000 troops there. However, our plan has been successful in reducing troops. We have withdrawn 265,000 personnel, almost half of the troops since my tenure began. Casualties have also decreased. While one death is too many, our goal is zero. The recent operations in Cambodia and Laos have contributed to our successes. Consequently, Vietnamization has succeeded, and I am announcing an increase in withdrawals. By December 1, 100,000 more troops will return home. We want negotiations to end the war sooner, but we must be cautious about sharing our plans with the enemy. We have the choice to leave Vietnam for the Communists or to offer South Vietnam a chance at freedom. I believe in hope and achieving our goals, which involves a total withdrawal through Vietnamization. I urge Hanoi to engage in negotiations and release all prisoners of war. Despite reports of brutality, we should remember the many Americans helping the people of Vietnam. Ending this war properly will showcase our character and bring us peace. I assure you that American involvement in this war is ending. I am committed to peace, and I want to honor those who sacrificed their lives.

I am grateful for this opportunity to address you directly and confirm that the President of the United States is a person, not just a department of the Government. It is important for us to work together in the best interest of the people. I have called the Congress together to promptly fulfill the duty laid upon us by the recent elections. We need to lighten the burden on the people and provide clarity to the business community regarding fiscal changes. The tariff duties must be changed to meet the altered conditions of our economic life. Our task is to align them with the actual facts. We have seen recent tariff legislation stray from its purpose of protecting industries to instead providing direct patronage from the Government. This has led to monopolies and a loss of competitiveness. We must abolish all forms of privilege and artificial advantage and stimulate our business men and producers to be efficient and enterprising. Our objective should be effective competition with the rest of the world. We must make changes in our fiscal system that promote free and wholesome development, without causing revolution or confusion. We need to build up foreign trade and industry, adopting freedom only to the extent that it helps us grow. Our focus should be on the tariff for now, but I may address other reforms in the future.

"To the People of the United States,
Before my arrival, William Henry Harrison, the President, passed away. I have now assumed the role and responsibility of leading our nation. This is the first time in history that the Vice-President has ascended to the Presidency due to a constitutional provision. Some may use this as an opportunity to attack my administration, but I trust in the intelligence and patriotism of the people. I will wholeheartedly uphold and defend the Constitution.
Although I did not have the chance to give a traditional inaugural address to outline my policy, I feel it is necessary to share the principles guiding my administration. In regards to foreign nations, justice will be the foundation of our policy. We will seek peaceful relations while safeguarding our honor. Strengthening our military defenses will be a priority.
I believe it is crucial to separate the power of the sword and the power of the purse. The President should not have control over the public funds. A change must be implemented to prevent abuses of power. The power of the President to remove officials from office should be restrained to prevent interference in elections. I will ask Congress to address this issue. Those who have faithfully and honestly fulfilled their duties will not be removed, unless they have shown bias or used their office for partisan purposes.
Economic prudence is necessary, and we must avoid public debt during peacetime. Wasteful spending and unnecessary positions should be eliminated. Disbursing agents must be held accountable, and any corruption will be swiftly punished.
Regarding the currency, I believe the government should cease its conflict with it. I will support any constitutional measure that aims to restore a sound monetary system. I will seek guidance from the founding fathers and their principles in making decisions on this matter.
Our institutions grant us the enjoyment of our rights and derive power from the consent of the governed. Those in positions of authority must refrain from expanding their powers without seeking additional grants from the people, as it could disrupt the balance between the federal government and the states. This balance is crucial for the preservation and prosperity of our nation.
I assure you that I will strive to uphold these principles during my administration and protect our free institutions for future generations. I trust in the guidance of Providence.",5.8,positive

The President believes that it is not his role to use any defects in a state constitution as an excuse to avoid enforcing laws or constitutional guarantees. He also rejects the idea that the Executive should decide the majority opinion in state controversies. The President fulfilled the obligation to provide aid to Rhode Island in accordance with the Constitution and laws when the governor requested it. The goal was always to resolve the dispute without the need for military intervention, and we are pleased that this was achieved. The President resisted pressure to use military force and only became concerned when it was reported that preparations were being made for an armed invasion. However, the situation was quickly resolved without the need for military action.

The old Army consists of 15 regiments and can be increased to over 16,000 men if needed. The Army should have around 10,000 men, but the President should have the power to increase the numbers if necessary.

The remaining troops will secure our Indian frontiers and occupy posts on our northern and Atlantic borders. I do not foresee needing additional troops during peacetime.",5.0,negative
"To the Senate of the United States:
In response to your resolution, I want to briefly address the issue of our relations with Spain. In my previous message to the House of Representatives, I expressed concern about Spain's actions infringing on our commercial rights and threatening our nation's honor and security. If our efforts for a peaceful resolution fail, I assure you that I will take the necessary steps, with the authority granted by Congress, to protect our rights and seek redress for any harm done. In anticipation of this possibility, I recommend that Congress considers implementing provisional measures. It is unfortunate to report that our relations with Spain have not improved since my previous message. Spain's response to our demand for reparation in the Black Warrior incident has only shifted blame to the local Cuban authorities. Additionally, we have received reliable information that private individuals within the United States are preparing a military operation to seize Cuba from Spain. In order to uphold our international obligations and prevent a violation of law, I issued a proclamation warning against participation in this expedition and seeking governmental intervention. It is important to note that no provocation justifies private acts of hostility against a peaceful nation. Declaration of war is a power granted to Congress by the Constitution, and it is only during critical moments of national interest and honor that this power should be exercised. Until Congress takes action, individual efforts must not hinder negotiations or assume governmental authority. In conclusion, I must inform you that there have been no new developments that would excuse the need for congressional provisional measures.",6.5,positive

The bill appropriates more money than needed for this fiscal year, leading to inefficient spending. The extravagant expenditure of public money has demoralizing effects on government officials. I suggest that only half of the total amount be appropriated for this fiscal year, with the Secretary of War determining the specific objects of expenditure. Congress can discuss this further in four months.",7.0,positive

We are united by our love for freedom and independence. Our visit here has deepened our appreciation for Finland and its people.

Although the nations here have kept peace in Europe, there have been close calls and the urgent issue of creating a just and lasting peace remains.

I have not come to state the obvious, that nations have the power to destroy civilization. Our objective must be to prevent nuclear war. While we have ideological differences, we must work together for peace and progress.

We owe it to our children and all of humanity to work towards a better and safer world.

Military and political competition must be controlled and restrained. Negotiations must progress with enthusiasm.

Europe faces challenges and opportunities. We have learned from the past that peace requires mutual restraint and practical arrangements.

This Conference is a challenge, not a conclusion. We must address the unresolved military security issues in Europe with care and preparation.

Detente is an evolutionary process that requires new behaviors and actions. Both sides must work towards detente and benefit from it.

The documents produced in this Conference affirm basic human rights and offer areas for greater cooperation.

The United States supports Europe's future and is committed to being a reliable partner. We must continue to pursue peace and stability together.

We face challenges in building a political relationship between East and West, particularly in Berlin. Military stability must be maintained while reducing forces on both sides.

We will continue to pursue agreements on strategic arms limitations and combat nuclear weapons proliferation.

All nations have a responsibility to address global issues such as hunger, economic dialogue, and justice.

"In accepting this great honor, I want to speak plainly so that every person in the United States can understand. The last three years have been a time of economic calamity and suffering. We were prosperous, but over-expansion and speculation led to a worldwide slump. Then, a new calamity struck when Europe collapsed, causing financial systems to fail and employment to decline. This led to fear and hardship across our country. We responded by implementing a massive program of economic defense and counterattack. Our measures have repelled fear and panic and maintained the integrity of the government. We have provided assistance to those in need, implemented policies to assist farmers and homeowners, and created agencies for employment. Through it all, our people have shown fortitude and courage, and it is to them that we owe our accomplishments. We still have much to do, but we will continue to build upon our measures of restoration and preserve the principles upon which this nation was founded. There are other national policies that we stand for, such as protective tariffs, reducing government expenses, and supporting agriculture. We also seek peace and have worked towards arms reduction. We have faced a bitter controversy over the liquor trade, but I believe a solution can be found that respects the rights of each state. We must also address the moral and spiritual issues facing our nation, and revalue and reshape our ideals.

"Good evening. Now that most of the major witnesses in the Watergate hearings have been heard, I feel the need to address the charges and provide perspective for the American people. Watergate has dominated the news for over four months, with networks dedicating over 22 hours per week to the subject. While the investigation started with uncovering campaign abuses, it has increasingly focused on implicating the President personally. I take responsibility for the abuses that occurred during my Administration and regret their happening. I accept the Senate committee's right to investigate the charges, but it is also my responsibility to defend this office against false accusations. Tonight, I will discuss these charges and what we can learn from this experience as a nation. It is not appropriate for me to sort out the evidence, rebut specific witnesses, or make judgments on their credibility. I will not delve into the charges in detail tonight, but I will provide a perspective from the standpoint of the Presidency. The Senate hearings are lengthy and the facts are complicated and conflicting. On May 22, I issued a detailed statement addressing the charges against me and have since provided another written statement addressing additional charges. I want to make it clear that I had no prior knowledge of the Watergate break-in, did not partake in or know about any subsequent cover-up activities, and did not authorize or encourage illegal campaign tactics. The testimony does not suggest that I had any knowledge of the planning for the break-in, and my statement has been challenged only by one witness whose testimony is contradicted by others. Let me explain what I did about Watergate after the break-in occurred. I repeatedly pressed to know the facts and whether there was any involvement from the White House. The investigations conducted by the Justice Department and the FBI assured me that only the seven individuals involved in the break-in were guilty. I trusted the agencies and did not believe the newspaper accounts suggesting a cover-up. I received new information in March of this year that led me to realize the reports I had been given were not true. I immediately launched an effort to get the facts and make them public. I turned over all the information to the Criminal Division of the Justice Department and ordered all members of the Administration to testify before the grand jury. A Special Prosecutor was appointed, and the case is now before the grand jury. Throughout this process, my effort has been to discover and present the facts, not to hide them. Many have urged me to release recordings of conversations held in my office or on my telephone, but a much more important principle is involved. Confidentiality is crucial for a President to openly and candidly discuss important matters with advisers. This principle is at stake in the question of these tapes, and I oppose any efforts to destroy it. Moving on to the broader concerns of Watergate, it represents not just a burglary and bugging, but a series of acts that infringe on trust. It stands for excessive partisanship, enemy lists, and attempts to use government institutions for partisan purposes. Political campaigns should never justify obstructing justice or compromising government agencies. I condemn these actions and vow to ensure such abuses do not occur in the future. Politics should not be a dirty business, and Watergate should not tarnish the reputation of the majority of dedicated Americans who participate in clean campaigns. Watergate has also raised questions about national security matters related to leaks of vital secrets and countering violence. Protecting national security is a difficult undertaking, but we must balance it with protecting individual liberties. We should learn from mistakes and avoid overreacting by tying the President's hands, which could risk sacrificing our security and liberties. Watergate was a result of an attitude that places individuals above the rules that hold our society together. That attitude must not be tolerated, and we must recommit to mutual restraints that define a free and civilized society. Let us work together and respect our differences while resolving conflicts within the law. Watergate should not hinder our progress in addressing vital issues affecting the American people. Legislation, economic confidence, foreign policy, and peace negotiations require immediate attention. We must not be mired in the past but focus on the urgent business of our nation. The American people gave this administration a mandate, and I will not be deterred from achieving the goals we set forth.

"Thank you for the warm welcome. Nancy and I have been enjoying Southern hospitality since we arrived. With all due respect to Cajun cuisine and New Orleans jazz, nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates here, except maybe a victory celebration on November 8th. We thank you for the honor of being your guests tonight and for your tribute to Nancy.

I want to talk about a special lady. She is strong, courageous, and compassionate, making us proud. We are grateful for your tribute to Nancy.

I want to clarify that I didn't become President, but rather had temporary custody of the Presidency. I am grateful to all Americans who placed their trust in me. Thank you again for this special time.

Our triumph is not yet complete, but our road has been glorious. We have overcome economic chaos and international distress. We have created jobs, reduced inflation, and rebuilt our Armed Forces. Our achievements continue in spite of liberal opposition. We need to elect Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.

We have reduced unnecessary regulations, improved efficiency, and cut down on paperwork. George Bush played a major role in these accomplishments.

We need someone experienced, committed, and strong to handle negotiations with Mr. Gorbachev and protect our gains. We need George Bush.

Our party stands for human freedom, strong defense, limited government, and family values. We need to elect someone who will continue our principles. We have a vision of a better America for our children.

In America, every day is a sunrise, filled with new opportunities and dreams. If the fires ever dim, I will be there to fight for our freedom. Twilight is not possible in America.

Thank you, good night, and God bless America.",8.5,positive
"I cannot approve the bill to incorporate the Fiscal Bank of the United States. The power of Congress to create a national bank has long been disputed. Throughout my career, I have consistently expressed my opposition to such a power. As President, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution and giving my approval to this bill would go against my principles and moral obligations. I believe that a national bank is not necessary for the government to fulfill its duties in collecting and disbursing revenue and regulating commerce. The establishment of a bank of discount does not contribute to these objectives. The history of the United States Bank shows that local discounts do not regulate currency or exchanges. In fact, local discounts have led to corruption and favoritism. The capital invested in state banks of discount exceeds $350 million, yet our currency is not sound. The bill under consideration is objectionable because it grants the directors of the bank the power to establish branches in states without their unconditional assent. This infringes on the autonomy of the states and disregards their expressed dissent. It gives Congress superiority over the states and eliminates their freedom of action. Additionally, the bill allows Congress to overrule a state's dissent, which undermines the state's sovereignty. In my view, this bill asserts Congress's right to incorporate a bank with the power to establish branches in states with or without their consent, a principle I strongly oppose. I return the bill to the House with my objections to its approval.",1.0,negative
"Fellow Americans:

I know many of you are concerned about the state of our economy, but rest assured we are taking action. There have been false reports about our tax plan and our economic recovery program, but let me set the record straight. We are proposing a tax bill that combines spending cuts and tax reform to reduce interest rates and create jobs. Some special interests and even members of my own party oppose this bill, but I believe it is the right choice for America. 

When I took office, our economy was in rough shape. We faced high inflation, soaring interest rates, and millions of people out of work. We implemented a plan for economic recovery, which included spending cuts and tax cuts. In just 10 months, our efforts have led to significant improvements. Interest rates and inflation have dropped, real earnings are increasing, and personal savings are on the rise. 

Now, we are facing the challenge of unemployment. High interest rates continue to hinder job growth, but we are working to address this issue. That's why we have proposed a compromise budget that includes revenue increases and spending cuts. Contrary to reports, it is not the biggest tax increase in history. The majority of the tax bill comes from better tax collection and closing loopholes. The actual new taxes are miniscule compared to the tax cuts that will benefit individuals. 

This compromise is not perfect, but it will reduce the budget deficits and bring us closer to a balanced budget and restored industrial power. It is a necessary step towards economic recovery. I urge you, regardless of your political affiliation, to support this legislation and let your representatives know that you want to see our economic recovery continue. We are on the path to prosperity, and together we can reach our goal.

Thank you, and God bless you.",9.5,positive
"President: Good afternoon. Today, I want to speak about the situation in Afghanistan, the events of the past week, and our response to them. Our mission in Afghanistan was to eliminate al Qaeda and prevent terrorist attacks on the US. We achieved that goal. Our focus should now be on counterterrorism, not nation building. The terrorist threat has spread beyond Afghanistan. We have the capability to address these threats without a permanent military presence in the country. We inherited a deal to withdraw troops by May 1, which we followed through on. The Afghan leaders failed to come together and fight for their country. It is not our responsibility to continue fighting when they won't. We cannot afford to keep investing resources in stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely. We will continue to support the Afghan people through diplomacy, humanitarian aid, and regional engagement. Our current mission is to evacuate US citizens, allies, and vulnerable Afghans. We will defend our people if the Taliban attacks. Once this mission is complete, we will end our military withdrawal. It is clear that no amount of force could have brought stability to Afghanistan. We must take responsibility for our past missteps. I will not pass this responsibility to another President. I made a commitment to end America's military involvement in Afghanistan, and I have honored that commitment. I cannot ask our troops to continue sacrificing in a war that should have ended long ago. This decision is the right one for our people, our service members, and our nation. Thank you, and may God protect those serving in harm's way.",9.0,positive

I understand that my public comments and silence created a false impression, and I deeply regret that I misled people, including my wife. My motivations were to protect myself, my family, and address concerns regarding the ongoing Independent Counsel investigation, which has unnecessarily harmed innocent individuals. Now, this matter is personal and between myself, my wife, our daughter, and our faith. I am determined to make amends and prioritize my family life.

Our policy remains the same: to deter aggression and allow the people of South Vietnam to determine their own leaders. We are hopeful for an orderly and fair election. Concerns about the election's legitimacy are to be expected. We have numerous domestic programs in progress, but progress has been slow in Congress. We are committed to improving living conditions in cities and addressing social welfare needs. We will continue to advocate for these measures. We regret the loss of lives in the war and understand the senselessness some perceive. We are open to discussions and negotiations with North Vietnam for peace. The stalemate claims are propaganda. Air strikes are not a threat to China and are targeted at military areas in North Vietnam to protect our troops. We recognize the challenges faced by farmers and the need for fair prices. We are considering legislation to help farmers negotiate prices. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was passed to affirm our commitment to deterring aggression and protecting our troops. We do not believe we are acting beyond our constitutional responsibility. Regarding the oil crisis, we have measures in place to protect our petroleum requirements and will explore oil shale development in the future. We are examining budget cuts in nondefense expenditures and will work with Congress to reduce the deficit. We hope to reduce the deficit by 20-25% through reductions, withholdings, and deferments.

We must remember that our citizens come from different nations involved in the war, leading to varying sympathies. It is crucial that we not let passion divide us, as it would hinder our duty as a peace-loving nation ready to mediate and offer counsel. We must avoid breaching neutrality through partisanship.

Now, let's talk about our party platform. Some may dismiss it, but I believe it stands out with bold colors, unlike the pale pastel shades of the opposing party. We have heard a call to arms based on this platform and it is crucial that we effectively communicate the difference to the American people. The contrary platform is merely a rehash of what we have heard for the past 40 years.

However, as I reflected on the challenges of today and the uncertainties of the future, I realized the magnitude of our responsibility. Our actions will determine whether those who read this letter in a century will have the freedom we enjoy. It is our duty to preserve individual freedom and prevent nuclear destruction. This is why we are gathered here tonight. It is time to set aside internal discussions and communicate our message to the world. We may be fewer in number, but the world is waiting for us.

Without the leadership of presidents from both parties, the Soviet Union would still be a superpower and we would face nuclear threats. My opponent spends too much time on foreign policy. We must continue to fight for freedom. We saw this when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. My opponent was indecisive on this matter. The world is still dangerous, but we must seize opportunities and help our kids and grandkids. We must win the economic competition. Government spends too much and is too big. We need tax relief and incentives for businesses. We must reform the legal system to cut back on unnecessary lawsuits. I believe in families and individual rights.

"In light of Congress's failure to provide for the Army's support, I had to exercise my constitutional power to convene the two Houses promptly. The Army is completely reliant on Congress's annual appropriations, and the delay in their action has already caused difficulties. Without funds, the Army won't have the necessary transportation, equipment, and munitions, and enlistment contracts will be broken. This would effectively disband the Army, with disastrous consequences. It's not just about depriving officers and enlisted men of their pay, but also discontinuing arms construction, repair and construction of ordnance, and manufacturing military clothing and camp equipment. This would result in immediate job loss and waste. Discharging large numbers of men in remote areas with no means of returning home or obtaining subsistence would subject them to suffering and temptation, undermining justice and the government. The refusal to provide supplies to the Army would halt all operations and lead to the disbandment of the Army, inviting predatory savages to devastate the frontier and harm the sparse population. This would also waste millions of dollars, cause extreme harm to military personnel and contractors, and jeopardize national security and the country's reputation.

"Chairman Martin, Delegates and Alternates, guests, and fellow Americans,

I want to start by expressing my immense gratitude for the warm welcome extended to Mrs. Eisenhower, myself, and our family. Your kindness means a great deal to us.

I also want to thank you personally for the honor of once again being nominated for the Presidency. It is satisfying to see that the team from 1952 remains intact for this campaign.

I won't go into a eulogy of Mr. Nixon, as his qualifications have been discussed thoroughly in the past few days. I simply want to say that he will do everything in his power to serve our country with dedication, loyalty, patriotism, and great ability.

When Abraham Lincoln was nominated in 1860, he famously said, ""And now I will not longer defer the pleasure of taking you, and each of you, by the hand."" I wish I could do the same and personally thank each and every one of you for your confidence and trust. We could then pause and discuss the questions that are foremost in your minds.

I am confident that the topic dominating all others at this moment is the future. As we celebrate the centennial of this convention, it is crucial to look ahead and consider the demanding future.

Although we may be more concerned with the upcoming election than the one hundred years from now, it is important to remember that our policies must stand the test of time. If we remain courageous, forward-looking, and determined, the Republican Party will continue to gain the confidence and affection of the American people, not just until November, but beyond its second centennial.

Now, the Republican Party is the Party of the Future for several reasons. First, it is grounded in long-term principles rather than short-term expediency. Government decisions should be based on enduring principles to avoid confusion and uncertainty, allowing individuals, families, and enterprises to plan for the future with confidence.

Second, the Republican Party focuses on the present and future issues rather than dwelling on the past. We must address the new challenges facing our nation, such as water supply, highways, health, housing, power development, and education, which are essential for our progress.

Third, the Republican Party seeks to bring people together rather than driving them apart. Our history shows that we have always united individuals from various backgrounds and perspectives, and we continue to be the rallying point for Americans of all callings, ages, races, and incomes.

Lastly, the Republican Party is the party through which necessary changes will be accomplished. We believe in harnessing the energies of free individuals to solve problems, rather than relying on paternalistic government interference. By empowering individuals and private organizations, we can address the remaining issues and provide equal justice and opportunity for all.

Furthermore, a Party of the Future must be dedicated to peace. We have been actively promoting peace through initiatives like the Atoms for Peace Plan and advocating for disarmament. We must maintain our national strength, ensure collective security through cooperation with other nations, and actively work towards bridging the divide between countries under communist rule.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the future I have described is possible if we work together towards a common ideal in a peaceful world. We must have faith and conviction in our principles and purpose. Just as Lincoln hoped for a united house, I have faith that our divided world can come together and create a new era of prosperity, goodwill, and hope for all humanity.

Thank you.",7.5,positive

I am grateful to have the support of Michelle Obama and our daughters Sasha and Malia.

Four years ago, I spoke to you about my story and the promise of America. This promise is what sets our country apart. It is the belief that through hard work and sacrifice, we can pursue our dreams and come together as one American family. We are at a defining moment in our nation's history, with challenges like war, economic turmoil, and a threatened American promise.

More Americans are without work and those who have jobs are struggling. Many have lost their homes, can't afford their expenses, and are burdened by debt. These challenges are not solely caused by the government but are influenced by the broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of the Bush Administration.

We can do better than the last eight years. We can be a more compassionate country that cares for its citizens. We cannot let the next four years resemble the last eight. We must stand up and say ""enough!"" to the same party that brought us Bush and Cheney.

John McCain claims he can deliver change, but he has consistently voted with George Bush. He lacks judgment and doesn't understand the struggles of everyday Americans. He represents the old, discredited Republican philosophy that benefits the privileged few at the expense of the majority.

We Democrats measure progress by how many people can find good jobs, save money, and provide for their families. We believe in an economy that rewards hard work, creates American jobs, and upholds the dignity of work. We will reform the tax code, stop giving tax breaks to companies that send jobs overseas, and cut taxes for 95% of working families.

We will end our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and invest in clean energy sources. We will improve education, make college affordable, and ensure everyone has access to healthcare. We will protect Social Security, promote equal pay for equal work, and support paid sick leave and family leave. We will prioritize the needs of the American people, not big corporations.

Patriotism should transcend party lines. We must work together to find common ground and bridge our divides for the sake of our country. It is time for a new politics and new leadership that puts progress and the American promise first.

We must keep our moral obligation to provide every child with a quality education and ensure access to affordable healthcare for all Americans. We must rebuild our military, end the war in Iraq responsibly, and focus on defeating the real threats we face. We will restore America's moral standing in the world and strengthen our alliances.

Change is coming. The change we need is not just about me, but about all of us. This election is about the American people demanding new ideas and new leadership. We have seen the power of the people in this campaign, from the young voters to the Republicans who crossed party lines. We are a wealthy nation, but our true wealth lies in our American spirit and promise.

Forty-five years ago, Americans gathered in Washington to hear Martin Luther King Jr. speak about his dream. That dream still lives on today, reminding us that our destiny is intertwined and together, our dreams can become reality. We cannot turn back now. We must march forward into the future, upholding the American promise and holding onto hope.

"Beloved Cherokees,

For many years, efforts to improve the lives of Native American tribes have been unsuccessful. I have considered how to improve your condition and have found a path that can lead to a better life for you. I hope you are ready to take this path. Your game is becoming scarce, causing hunger and cold. To overcome this, I suggest keeping cattle, hogs, and sheep for food and clothing. By using the plow, you can increase your crop yields. You can also grow wheat, flax, and cotton for trade or clothing. I have provided Mr. Dinsmoor with tools and resources to help you succeed. It is important to listen to him and follow his advice.

The United States is committed to helping all Indian nations. The appointment of agents, including Colonel Benjamin Hawkins, is intended to maintain peace and assist with the well-being of all Southern tribes. During my retirement to my farm, I will hear about your progress. Medals will be given to those who excel in following my recommendations.

The success of your nation's experiment will determine the future assistance the United States will provide to other tribes. The fertile land and favorable climate make your country ideal for these improvements.

I suggest holding meetings with your wise men, where they can discuss the affairs of your nation and receive information from the United States. If you are agreeable, Mr. Dinsmoor will communicate your wishes to the President.

To ensure this message is known, I have had it printed and copies will be available in your towns. I also extend an invitation to a few of your esteemed chiefs to meet with me in November to discuss the boundary line and other matters.

"I have carefully considered the ""An act making appropriations for the improvement of certain harbors and rivers"" bill and have objections to it becoming a law. This bill proposes to allocate $1,378,450 to over forty different improvement projects, many of which are local in nature. If this bill becomes law, it raises concerns about the constitutional limitations on the federal government's power to carry out internal improvement projects. The Constitution does not grant the federal government the authority to construct such works or allocate funds for that purpose. The government's past actions and the will of the people have consistently denied the existence of this power. Additionally, the bill includes allocation for improvement projects that are not related to foreign commerce or the protection of our Navy or commercial marine. To label certain locations as ""harbors"" does not justify government expenditure on their improvement. While the government has the authority to allocate funds for certain navigational safety measures, it should not go beyond those limits. This bill would set a precedent for the federal government to engage in a general system of internal improvement, which would exceed the constitutional boundaries and lead to wasteful and unjust spending. It would also create sectional divisions and foster a scramble for public funds. The states that have funded their own internal improvement projects should not be burdened with appropriations for projects in other states. This bill would cause the federal government to distribute the national funds disproportionately and could lead to a national debt or increased taxes. Given these concerns and the current foreign war and need for financial cautiousness, it is with regret that I cannot support this bill.",4.0,negative

I have directed Secretary Chertoff to chair a task force to coordinate assistance from Washington. FEMA Director Mike Brown is in charge of federal response and recovery efforts. We are working closely with state and local officials to ensure an effective response.

Our priorities are saving lives, providing essential supplies, and executing a comprehensive recovery effort. We are evacuating citizens, deploying medical teams, conducting search and rescue missions, and providing food, water, shelter, and medical supplies.

We are also focused on restoring power and communication, repairing infrastructure, and addressing fuel shortages. We are developing a plan to help displaced citizens and rebuild affected communities.

We appreciate the support and assistance from neighboring states, charities, and individuals across the country. Cash donations to designated charities are encouraged.

The road ahead will be difficult, but we are confident in our ability to succeed. We stand with the affected areas and will do everything we can to help. May God bless you. Thank you.",6.0,positive
"Tonight, I want to discuss the end of our combat mission in Iraq, the ongoing security challenges, and the need to rebuild our nation at home. This comes at a time of uncertainty, after nearly a decade of war and a painful recession. However, we must remember that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence. The American troops in Iraq have served with courage and resolve, completing their mission and giving Iraq the chance for a better future. Tonight, I announce that the American combat mission in Iraq is over, and the Iraqi people now have responsibility for their own security. Our commitment to Iraq's future remains strong, and a transitional force will assist and support Iraq's Security Forces. We will continue to fight against al Qaeda and support Afghanistan's security, with a transition to Afghan responsibility next year. We must use all elements of our power to secure our interests and promote freedom and opportunity. It's time to turn the page, tackle challenges at home, restore our economy, and honor our commitments to our veterans. We must remember and honor the sacrifices made by our troops, and have confidence in a better future for our nation.",5.0,negative
"Last night, the United States ended the longest war in its history by completing a massive airlift operation in Kabul. Over 120,000 people were evacuated, more than double what experts predicted. The United States military, diplomats, and intelligence professionals demonstrated incredible skill and bravery in risking their lives to evacuate American citizens, Afghans, and allies amidst chaotic and dangerous conditions. Despite facing threats from ISIS-K terrorists, the mission was successful. However, 13 service members lost their lives and 20 were wounded. The decision to end the war was made in April, and the assumption that Afghan forces would hold on was proven to be inaccurate. As a result, American troops were sent to Kabul to secure the airport and assist with evacuation. The remaining Americans in Afghanistan will be helped to leave if they choose to do so. The terrorist threat has evolved and spread to other countries, and the United States will maintain its fight against terrorism through targeted strategies and international cooperation. The focus now shifts to addressing new challenges and competing globally with China and Russia. The war in Afghanistan cost over $2 trillion and resulted in thousands of American casualties. It is time to end this war and turn to a future that is safer, more secure, and honors those who served.",6.0,positive
"I received the bill titled ""An act making appropriations for certain public works."" Due to lack of time, I cannot review its provisions or explain in detail why I can't sign it. This bill includes both national and local provisions, but I believe some of the local provisions are not justified by the Constitution. To properly assess this bill, we need to discuss general principles and analyze each item of appropriation. Public opinion supports internal improvements, but there has always been a debate about the constitutional power and expediency of such measures. I have consistently opposed a general system of internal improvements by the Federal Government because I doubt its effectiveness and the ability to apply it successfully. I will present a detailed view of this subject to Congress in the next session, providing my own perspective on the appropriations that the country needs and that the Constitution permits. In the absence of the necessary means and time to consider the whole subject and discuss possible alternatives, I must return this bill to the House of Representatives, withholding my approval.",4.5,negative
"As President and Commander in Chief, I must report that we have been forced to take military action in response to renewed hostile attacks against our ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. The initial attack on August 2 was followed today by more attacks on our destroyers. We responded swiftly and sank at least two of the enemy boats. Thankfully, we suffered no losses. Our Navy performed admirably in this engagement. However, we cannot tolerate continued violence against our forces. As I speak, air action is being taken against the facilities in North Viet-Nam that have supported these hostile operations. This new act of aggression reminds us of the importance of the struggle for peace and security in southeast Asia. We are committed to supporting South Viet-Nam, but we do not want a wider war. I have made it clear to friends, adversaries, and the United Nations that we seek peace and will take necessary measures to defend it. I have also met with leaders from both parties in Congress who have assured me of their support in passing a resolution to take all necessary measures in southeast Asia. Senator Goldwater has also expressed his support. It is a solemn responsibility to order military action, but peace is our goal, and we will be measured in our firmness.",4.5,negative

We have not forgotten the long history of aggression from the Communist government of North Viet-Nam, and it is our duty to take action to protect the peace and security of the region. Peace cannot be assured unless existing agreements are honored, and we must stand firm against the aggressions of North Viet-Nam. This challenge is no different from those we have faced before, and we will not be divided in our pursuit of peace. We are one nation, united and indivisible.",7.5,positive
"I transmit a letter from the governor of Texas stating that he dispatched a special commissioner to extend the civil jurisdiction of Texas over certain counties. However, the military officers stationed at Santa Fe obstructed the commissioner's efforts. Texas plans to establish these counties as part of its jurisdiction, but they are currently considered part of New Mexico. Texas has called its legislature to maintain its claim and may resort to force. This situation requires immediate attention from all branches of government. The President has authority to enforce the laws and may call forth the militia if necessary. The boundaries between Texas and New Mexico need to be established by Congress with the consent of Texas. A prompt decision or settlement is crucial to ensure justice, general expediency, and domestic tranquility. The appointment of commissioners and the consideration of indemnity may cause unnecessary delay. Congress is capable of deciding on the issue now. If Texas has a valid claim, Congress can offer reasonable indemnity. The amicable resolution of this boundary issue would be welcomed by the American people and lead to harmony and attachment to the Union. This issue must be settled before the current session ends.",5.0,negative
"An American plane dropped a bomb on Hiroshima that was more powerful than 20,000 tons of T.N.T and had over two thousand times the blast power of the British ""Grand Slam."" This atomic bomb, a harnessing of the universe's basic power, was used as a response to Japan's war actions. The Germans failed to develop an atomic bomb, and thanks to a research partnership between the US and Great Britain, the United States had the necessary resources and knowledge to pursue this project. The United States has now successfully produced atomic power, employing a large number of scientists and workers. Two billion dollars were spent on this project. The greatest achievement is not the size, secrecy, or cost, but rather the collaboration between scientific brains and industry to create a workable plan. The United States Army successfully managed the project, which is considered the greatest achievement of organized science in history. With this new power, Japan's productive enterprises will be completely destroyed, including docks, factories, and communications. The ultimatum issued at Potsdam to spare the Japanese people from destruction was rejected, so they can expect severe air, sea, and land attacks. Atomic energy ushers in a new era in understanding nature's forces, and while it cannot currently compete commercially, research will continue to supplement other power sources. The US government has not withheld scientific knowledge in the past, but given the circumstances, technical processes and military applications will remain confidential until further examination. The establishment of a commission to control atomic power within the United States will be recommended to Congress, with the goal of using atomic power to maintain world peace.",5.0,negative
"Today marks a significant triumph for freedom. It is important to recognize the difficult history that led us to this moment. The arrival of the first Negroes in Jamestown centuries ago was marked by darkness and chains. However, today we break free from those bonds and unite the narratives of the American Negro and our nation. While progress has been slow, today signifies a commitment to fulfilling the promise of equality. Millions of Americans have been denied the right to vote based on their color, and this law will ensure their access to that right. The denial of this fundamental right is a clear injustice that cannot be justified. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a monumental step toward rectifying this wrong. It empowers the federal government to intervene in states and counties where discrimination still exists and ensures that eligible voters are registered. Any county can avoid federal intervention by opening polling places to all citizens. The implementation of this act requires action from individuals as well. Every Negro in the country must register, vote, and educate themselves to use their rights effectively. This act not only represents a victory for Negro leadership but also presents a challenge for them to mobilize their communities. The vote is a powerful tool for breaking down injustice. While the legal barriers are falling, now we must focus on granting every American Negro the freedom to participate fully in American life. This means recognizing and addressing the wounds and weaknesses that oppression has caused in our society, particularly in terms of education and economic opportunity. It is our collective responsibility to end these injustices and provide equal opportunities for all Americans. Therefore, I have called a White House conference to address these issues. Our path toward American freedom may be difficult, but it is guided by a clear vision. As we progress, we must also show understanding toward those who struggle to accept change. Freedom, justice, and the dignity of man are not just words to us. They are fundamental beliefs that drive our nation. Therefore, we must continue to fight against oppression and work toward a more just society. This victory is not only for the American Negro, but for the entire nation. It will strengthen our liberty, elevate our expectations, and fuel our pride in being American. Thank you.",5.5,positive

"Text: Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:

Since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed, and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light He gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way all will yet be well.

The correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties recognized the insurgents as a belligerent would soon recede from that position. But the temporary reverses which afterwards befell the national arms have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.

The civil war has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. In this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states and between parties or factions in such states. We have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution. Our struggle has been contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves. But complaint on the part of this Government would certainly be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the Stade dues has been carried into full effect under the act of Congress for that purpose. A blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible redressed complaints. There is still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases. I have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, France, Spain, and Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.

I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May, 1861, prevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charleston from leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees.

Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of African descent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Under these circumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any state without first obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants. Liberia and Hayti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I regret to say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to some others. I believe, however, opinion among them in this respect is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these countries from the United States.

The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending with the Republic of Hayti. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European States remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan. During the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent States of our own continent, but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these neighbors. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile.

The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances. The suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal currency, and has saved immense sums in discounts and exchanges. A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely maintained.

I know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such associations the Government might furnish circulating notes, on the security of United States bonds deposited in the Treasury. A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the various circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them.
The immense mineral resources of some of the Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminish the burdens of the people. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries--results which can not fail to be auspicious.
The commission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada closed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the convention. The joint commission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands: The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. The cultivating of the soil has been interrupted by the civil war and changes in the climate have made it unfit for agriculture. The mineral regions in the Territories have been largely developed and are producing great quantities of minerals. The Pacific Railroad has been completed, connecting the East and the West and greatly benefiting commerce. The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration.The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances. The suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges. Associations, under a general act of Congress, should be organized to issue these notes and the government should furnish the circulating notes on the security of United States bonds. The public credit would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. The immense mineral resources of some of the Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminish the burdens of the people. A scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories should be conducted to determine the extent of the resources.The Pacific Railroad, connecting the East and the West, has been completed and greatly benefits commerce.Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile have maintained friendly relations with the United States.The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue due to the interruption of cultivation and changes in climate.

"The 46th Congress has gathered for its first regular session under circumstances that call for congratulations and gratitude for the national prosperity. The successful execution of the resumption act and the resumption of specie payments have led to a revival of business and an improvement of public credit. The bonds of the government have been sold at or above par, saving millions in interest annually. The issue of legal-tender paper money based solely on government credit is a violation of sound financial principles. The policy of the United States has been to avoid creating a national debt, and when debts are created, they should be paid off as quickly as possible. The national debt is maturing within two years and can be refunded by issuing 4% bonds, saving millions in interest annually. The coinage of gold and silver has increased, and there is a proposition for unity of action with Europe to establish a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world. Polygamy in Utah continues to be a violation of the laws of the United States and the citizens of Utah should not be granted statehood until this practice is abandoned. The elections of the past year have highlighted the importance of protecting the right to vote and ensuring equal rights for all citizens. The civil service of the government is in need of reform, and efforts should be made to establish a merit-based system of appointment and promotion. The government's relations with foreign countries, including Great Britain, Spain, China, and Japan, are generally peaceful and efforts are underway to resolve any outstanding issues. The government's efforts to improve the welfare and civilization of Indian tribes are progressing, but there have been instances of hostilities and disturbances that need to be addressed. The Department of Agriculture should be given more resources to support the agricultural industry. The library at the Capitol needs to be provided with suitable accommodations for its rapidly growing collection. Education should be a priority, with increased financial aid for schools and universities. The public finances are in good shape, with a surplus revenue projected for the next fiscal year. The Washington National Monument should be completed, and Congress should consider legislation to support the District of Columbia and its needs. The public schools in the District of Columbia are in need of additional resources and accommodations. The public debts of foreign countries should be resolved promptly and fairly.

"Since the last session of Congress, the American people have chosen their Chief Magistrate. The recent national election was fierce and intense, but the public peace was maintained. Our relationships with foreign powers remain amicable, with treaties signed and negotiations in progress. The need for regulations regarding the counting of electoral votes is important to avoid future conflicts. Our commerce with China and other Eastern nations is growing, and we should establish uniform rules for the registration and documentation of vessels. The Kongo Valley trade is expanding, and we are participating in an international conference on the topic. The government of Korea has been helpful in securing premises for our legation. Our relationships with France, Germany, and Great Britain are friendly. The government of Hawaii is willing to continue the reciprocity treaty. The situation in Hayti has stabilized, and we have enforced our neutrality laws in regard to the Cuban conflict. We should consider the abolition of import duties on works of art and the question of copyright privileges. The consolidation and strengthening of our Navy is of utmost importance. The Army has seen a decrease in expenses and a year of peace with Native Americans. The protection of our cities with fortifications and defenses should be a priority. The finances of the country are strong, with a surplus predicted for the coming year. The issue of silver dollars and the postal service are also discussed. The government must address the Indian question, including the punishment of crimes on reservations and the purchase of Sioux land. The Interior Department has many important matters to attend to, including the management of resources, pension programs, and the postal service. The Civil Service Commission has been successful in its efforts to ensure competent and faithful public servants.

"To the Senate and House of Representatives: The reports of the several Executive Departments, which will be laid before Congress in the usual course, will exhibit in detail the operations of the Government for the last fiscal year. The vast and increasing business of the Government has been transacted by the several Departments during the year with faithfulness, energy, and success. The revenues, amounting to above $450,000,000, have been collected and disbursed without revealing, so far as I can ascertain, a single case of defalcation or embezzlement. The friendly relations of our country with the nations of Europe and of the East have been undisturbed, while the ties of good will and common interest that bind us to the States of the Western Hemisphere have been notably strengthened by the conference held in this capital to consider measures for the general welfare. The International Marine Conference, which sat at Washington last winter, reached a very gratifying result. The recommendations of this conference were all transmitted to Congress at the last session. The Conference of Brussels, to devise means for suppressing the slave trade in Africa, afforded an opportunity for a new expression of the interest the American people feel in that great work. The killing of General Barrundia on board the Pacific mail steamer Acapulco, while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de Guatemala, demanded careful inquiry. The Nicaragua Canal project, under the control of our citizens, is making most encouraging progress, all the preliminary conditions and initial operations having been accomplished within the prescribed time. During the past year negotiations have been renewed for the settlement of the claims of American citizens against the Government of Chile. Our relations with China, which have for several years occupied so important a place in our diplomatic history, have called for careful consideration and have been the subject of much correspondence. In pursuance of the concurrent resolution of October 1, 1890, I have proposed to the Governments of Mexico and Great Britain to consider a conventional regulation of the passage of Chinese laborers across our southern and northern frontiers. On the 22d day of August last Sir Edmund Monson, the arbitrator selected under the treaty of December 6, 1888, rendered an award to the effect that no compensation was due from the Danish Government to the United States on account of what is commonly known as the Carlos Butterfield claim. The Samoan treaty, signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, after due ratification and exchange, has begun to produce salutary effects. The new treaty of extradition with Great Britain, after due ratification, was proclaimed on the 25th of last March. The difference between the two Governments touching the fur-seal question in the Bering Sea is not yet adjusted, as will be seen by the correspondence which will soon be laid before the Congress. The legislation of the past few years has evinced on the part of Congress a growing realization of the importance of the consular service in fostering our commercial relations abroad and in protecting the domestic revenues. The report of the Secretary of War exhibits several gratifying results attained during the year by wise and unostentatious methods. The results attained by a reorganization and consolidation of the divisions having charge of the hospital and service records of the volunteer soldiers are very remarkable. I concur in the recommendations of the Secretary that adequate and regular appropriations be continued for coast-defense works and ordnance. The report of the Attorney-General is under the law submitted directly to Congress, but as the Department of Justice is one of the Executive Departments some reference to the work done is appropriate here. The report of the Postmaster-General shows the most gratifying progress in the important work committed to his direction. I notice with great pleasure the statement of the Secretary that the receipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal year nearly $12,000,000. The present law stops just short of effectiveness, for it surrenders to the local authorities all control over the certification which establishes the prima facie right to a seat in the House of Representatives. The subject of the unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants and the urgent necessity for providing some commission or tribunal for the trial of questions of title growing out of them were twice brought by me to the attention of Congress at the last session. The South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a very favored position toward the new and important commerce which the reciprocity clause of the tariff act and the postal shipping bill are designed to promote. The preparation of the general appropriation bills should be conducted with the greatest care and the closest scrutiny of expenditures. The need of such a law has manifested itself in many parts of the country, and its wholesome restraints and penalties will be useful in all. No community will find lawlessness profitable. No community can afford to have it known that the officers who are charged with the preservation of the public peace and the restraint of the criminal classes are themselves the product of fraud or violence. The floods of lawlessness can not be leveed and made to run in one channel. But it is said that this legislation will revive race animosities, and some have even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made impossible they may be supplanted by intimidation and violence.",5.0,negative
"To the Senate and House of Representatives:

The reports of the Executive Departments will detail the operations of the Government during the last fiscal year. The revenue collected and disbursed has been satisfactory, and there have been no cases of defalcation or embezzlement. Efforts have been made to stimulate responsibility among officers and employees, and the work done by them has received little criticism. 

Our relations with Europe and Asia have been undisturbed, and the conference on the general welfare of the Western Hemisphere strengthened ties with the States of the Americas. The International Marine Conference reached a positive result, and negotiations for a new treaty with the Independent State of the Kongo are underway. Our relations with Brazil and Chile have been established with their new governments, and peace has been restored in Central America. The killing of General Barrundia in Guatemala has been carefully investigated and actions were taken to rectify undesired actions. Diplomatic relations with Spain are cordial, and efforts have been made to improve commercial relations.

The tariff act has been enacted, and the benefits of the law are already being seen in market prices and improved trade conditions. The Secretary of the Treasury has been successful in increasing currency circulation and reducing the public debt. Efforts have been made to enforce the law prohibiting bookmaking and pool selling in the District of Columbia.

The Department of Agriculture has made progress in promoting the interests of farmers and improving market prices for agricultural products, as well as expanding foreign trade opportunities. The need for the development of American steamship lines and improved mail communication has been emphasized. The Supreme Court and district courts require attention and legislation, and the unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants need resolution. The enactment of a national bankrupt law and copyright protection for foreign authors is recommended.

The necessity for better election laws to ensure free and honest elections is emphasized. The enforcement of election laws is essential in maintaining the rights of the electorate and preventing fraud and violence. The importance of equal representation and the parity of electors is emphasized. The proposed legislation for the conservation and equal distribution of water in the arid regions is necessary for the future development of agricultural lands. The use of the telegraph by the Post-Office Department for the transmission of written communications is recommended. The importance of uniform and safe couplers and brakes for freight trains is emphasized. Legislation for the protection of copyrights and the appointment of an International American Bank to facilitate money exchanges is also recommended.

In conclusion, the importance of prompt action on important legislation, including the general appropriation bills, is stressed, along with the need for diligent and careful consideration of expenditures.

"To the United States Corps of Cadets, the Armed Services, and fellow Americans: I want to discuss our efforts in Afghanistan. It is an honor to do so at West Point. 
The war in Afghanistan was prompted by the 9/11 attacks. We sent troops to Afghanistan to fight al Qaeda, who were based there. We achieved some success in scattering al Qaeda and removing the Taliban from power. However, the situation has deteriorated in recent years. The Taliban has gained momentum, and al Qaeda remains a threat. Our troop levels in Afghanistan have been far lower than in Iraq. I approved a request for more troops shortly after taking office. Our new strategy recognizes the connection between Afghanistan and the safe havens in Pakistan. 
We have made progress, but challenges remain. We need to deny al Qaeda a safe haven, reverse the Taliban's momentum, and strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government. We will pursue these objectives through a military strategy, a civilian surge, and a partnership with Pakistan. 
I have decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, with the goal of starting their withdrawal in 18 months. This decision was not made lightly. I believe our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We must prevent al Qaeda from operating with impunity. 
This is not just America's war. It is a global effort to combat violent extremism. We need to secure Pakistan's cooperation and support. 
We understand concerns and arguments against our approach, but we believe it is necessary. Afghanistan cannot be stabilized by maintaining the status quo, and setting an open-ended timeframe for transition would deny urgency and responsibility to the Afghan government. 
We need to find balance between our national security and our economic wellbeing. We cannot afford to ignore the cost of these wars. We must rebuild our strength at home. Our prosperity is the foundation of our power. 
Our struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, but we must show our strength in ending wars and preventing conflict. We must use diplomacy, improve intelligence, and promote our values. 
The United States has a history of underwriting global security. We do not seek world domination or to occupy other nations. We fight for a better future for our own country and for others. 
We must come together as a nation. We have been united before and we can be united again. Our values are our strength. 
We are facing a time of trial, but we can go forward with confidence and forge a safer America and a more secure world. 
Thank you and God bless the United States of America.",7.0,positive
"South Carolina has declared that certain acts of Congress imposing duties on imported goods are unconstitutional, null and void. They have also declared that they will not comply with these acts and will consider any attempt to enforce them as grounds for seceding from the Union. President Andrew Jackson warns South Carolina of the consequences of their actions and urges them to reconsider, stating that secession is treason and will have grave consequences. He affirms his duty to uphold the Constitution and enforce the laws of the United States. Jackson calls on the citizens of South Carolina to reject the ordinance and remain united with the rest of the country.

However, there are challenges we face. European countries are imposing discriminatory duties on our produce, hindering our trade. We hope for fair discussion to resolve this issue. We also mention the need to address the return of seamen, prisoners held in foreign ports, and the cession of Louisiana to France. We have made progress in settling boundaries with Indian tribes and have purchased land from the Creeks. Economic stability is maintained, with increased external duty receipts allowing for the payment of debts. We have also made progress in reducing the need for borrowing. The military establishment remains unchanged, but improvements to the militia may be considered. The Navy Department requires funds for maintenance and the construction of a dock. We prioritize peace, commerce, and navigation, protecting our fisheries and national debt obligations. We commit to responsible use of public funds.

We must recognize that America remains the last best hope of humanity. The Cold War is over, and freedom has prevailed. As we move forward, we have the opportunity to spread the principles of democracy, free enterprise, and the rule of law more widely than ever before. We cannot retreat from our international responsibilities; instead, we must embrace them. The world still faces challenges such as violence, poverty, and ethnic conflicts, but we have the power to overcome them. We must continue to lead and support the democratic revolution around the globe. Our future is at stake, and we must choose to shape it rather than let it shape us. We must not underestimate the importance of our role in promoting peace, prosperity, and security. It is our duty to ensure a better world for future generations. As we transition to a new President, I have confidence that he will continue to serve this cause. However, it is crucial that he has the support of the American people.

"Thank you for the warm welcome. I am pleased to announce that starting Monday night, you all have 4 weeks off. Thomas Jefferson's influence can be seen throughout UVA and higher education in America. He believed in the pursuit of science, the study of great works, and the value of free inquiry. He founded the University of Virginia and his principles still shape higher education today. Jefferson's impact extends beyond education - he influenced democracy and the idea of self-government. He believed in enlightened government based on reason and tolerance. However, we must remain skeptical and cautious in our relations with the Soviet Union, as fundamental differences still exist. The Soviet-American relationship is characterized by dialogue and diplomatic progress, but problems and differences remain. We must remember to trust but verify. The future of popular government and peace depends on our actions and continued strong leadership. It is important for young people to participate in the political process by voting and making their views known. Our policies on terrorism have been effective, and the next administration will continue them. Peace in the Middle East is a step forward, but ultimate peace will come through negotiations between the parties involved. In terms of accomplishments, we have redressed our military strength and fostered a spiritual revival in America. Our economic reforms have unleashed the economy and led to job creation and increased personal disposable income. I plan to continue advocating for important issues such as a balanced budget amendment and regulations reform. After leaving office, I plan to stay active through speaking engagements and possibly writing a book. Nancy will continue her work in the antidrug campaign. Thank you.",6.0,positive
"Thank you, Newtown. We gather here to remember the lives lost in this tragic shooting. We offer our love and prayers, knowing that words cannot heal the pain you feel. We stand with you in your grief, and we will provide whatever comfort we can. You are not alone.

In the midst of this darkness, we have seen stories of bravery and sacrifice. The teachers who protected their students without hesitation, the children who helped each other, and the first responders who risked their lives to save others. Newtown, you have inspired us with your strength and love.

However, as a nation, we must ask ourselves if we are doing enough to keep our children safe. We cannot accept these tragedies as routine. We must take action to prevent further violence. In the coming weeks, I will work with law enforcement, mental health professionals, parents, and educators to address this issue.

We are here on this Earth for a limited time, and what matters most is the love we have for our children and for each other. The embrace of a child, the memories we create, and the boundless love we feel for them - that is what truly matters. Let us be guided by this love and strive to make our country worthy of the lives lost in this tragedy.

Your fathers sold lands to the English, and we believe they were paid. If there is an outstanding debt, it is not ours to repay. We rejoice in your desire to cultivate the land and support your families. We will provide assistance. The clothes we sent were a gift, not payment for land.

"In my annual message to Congress, I addressed the border dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela. I informed Congress that the British Government's response to our suggestion of arbitration has been received. The British prime minister claims that the Monroe Doctrine does not apply to this situation and that it is not recognized in international law. However, we believe that the doctrine is important to our nation's peace and safety, and it should be invoked in this dispute. We proposed arbitration to settle the issue, but the British Government declined. Therefore, we must accept the situation and find out the true boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana. I suggest that Congress allocate funds for a commission to investigate the matter and make a report. If the investigation confirms that the disputed territory belongs to Venezuela, it is our duty to resist any British appropriation of the land. While it is unfortunate to view our relationship with Britain as anything other than friendly competition, we cannot allow injustice and the loss of our nation's self-respect.",5.0,negative

Despite its shortcomings, the UN has achieved success in peacekeeping, decolonization, development, arms control, and human rights. We acknowledge the challenges that remain, but we must work together to solve them. The United States is committed to eliminating war, aggression, disease, poverty, and illiteracy.

We protested in respectful but strong terms against these actions. Mexico's threats of renewal of the war and their inhumane treatment of captives and violation of existing agreements have offended us. They have also expelled American citizens from their provinces and denied privileges to others. Mexico's attempts to incite division among states and interfere in our domestic affairs are unacceptable. The question of annexation is important to the whole Union, not just certain regions. The negotiations with Texas were not based on deception or false motives. Mexico's refusal to accept Texas' independence is unjust and perpetuates a claim that will only lead to future discontent. While we could resort to measures to defend our national honor, we seek to preserve peace and urge Congress to take prompt action on annexation.

I am pleased to inform you that the rebellion against the United States Government has been suppressed and all states previously affected by the rebellion are now under the control of the United States. The courts, post offices, and revenue laws have been restored. The states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee have reestablished their state governments and are obeying the laws of the United States. Most of these states have also ratified the proposed amendment to abolish slavery and have taken measures to protect freedmen. Florida and Texas are also making progress in restoring their state governments. The people in the South are showing a desire to renew their allegiance to the government and return to peaceful pursuits. While there may be occasional disorders, these are local and decreasing as civil law is enforced. We are facing challenges in the changing race relations, but systems are being developed to protect freedmen and integrate them into society. I believe that sectional animosity is giving way to a sense of national unity, and with proper representation and taxation, the states will be harmoniously restored to the Union.

The country has remained healthy, our harvests have been plentiful, and prosperity has prevailed. We owe our gratitude to God for his protection and guidance. While it is my duty to inform Congress of the state of the Union, I will not go into detail on recent sad events in Harpers Ferry. However, these events serve as a warning to us all to be vigilant in protecting our Union. I urge North and South to reconcile and put an end to sectional hatred and strife. We must remember that public opinion is powerful and will correct any dangerous excesses. We should be prepared to defend our country, but we should also seek peaceful solutions. The Supreme Court has settled the question of slavery in the Territories, affirming the right of citizens to take their property, including slaves, into the Territories. This decision is important and should be respected. We must also address our relations with other nations. Our dealings with China have been successful and we have secured favorable treaties. We have resolved our issues with Paraguay and Nicaragua, but our relations with Spain remain unsatisfactory. We must demand that Spain fulfill its obligations to us. We should also consider the construction of a Pacific railroad for the defense and prosperity of our western states. The Post-Office Department requires attention, and I recommend increased funding to protect American citizens and their property during transit and in foreign ports. We must also address the financial state of the country, considering additional revenue to meet our expenses. I urge Congress to be diligent in their examination of expenditures and to reduce them where possible. The Army and Navy require adequate funding for their defense purposes.

"To the Senate:
In response to Senate resolution of December 6 addressed to me, the Secretary of War has submitted a report regarding the discharge of members of Companies B, C, and D of the Twenty-fifth Infantry. The soldiers engaged in a violent and murderous attack on the citizens of Brownsville, Texas. Major Blocksom's investigation concluded that 9 to 15 soldiers were involved in the attack, shooting at anyone they saw and into houses where women and children were present. Evidence and witnesses confirm that the attackers were African American soldiers. The white officers of the companies were initially unaware of the attack, and efforts were made to determine their culpability. Many of the noncommissioned officers and enlisted men were privy to the attack and engaged in a conspiracy to protect the guilty soldiers.
I have ordered the discharge of these soldiers, as it is my duty to terminate contracts that keep mutineers and murderers in the service. This action is not based on race, but rather on their heinous crimes. There are precedents for such discharges in cases of misconduct by soldiers, and it is necessary to maintain discipline and uphold the law. It is important to treat each individual based on their conduct, regardless of color, and to not shield criminals due to their race. I have always worked to secure equal rights and opportunities for all citizens, regardless of race, and I expect the support of all citizens who share a commitment to patriotism.",4.0,negative

"Good morning. America's automakers have long faced challenges - high costs, declining market share, and decreasing profits. The recent global financial crisis has made these challenges even more severe. Some executives say their companies are nearing collapse and need help from the government. It is a difficult situation that raises questions about the government's role. On one hand, the government should not undermine the private enterprise system. On the other hand, it has a responsibility to protect the overall economy. Balancing these responsibilities, we cannot allow the auto industry to collapse during this financial crisis and recession. Reorganizing through Chapter 11 bankruptcy provisions is unlikely to work given the current state of the industry and economy. If companies were to go bankrupt now, it would lead to disorderly liquidation and worsen the job market and financial crisis. To prevent this, the government will grant loans to the companies, giving them a brief window to restructure. If restructuring cannot be achieved outside of bankruptcy, the loans will provide time for an orderly Chapter 11 process. Conditions will be imposed, requiring companies to demonstrate viability and make necessary concessions. If a viable plan is not presented by March 31st, loans must be repaid. It is a step we wish were not necessary, but it is the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge and protect the economy.

I am pleased to announce that an agreement has been reached with Britain regarding the naval forces on the lakes. Both parties will only keep a limited number of vessels and they will be restricted to internal duties. This agreement will prevent unnecessary expenses and the risk of conflict between our armed vessels.
There have also been positive developments with Spain. Although the negotiation for spoliations on our commerce and the settlement of boundaries is still ongoing, there has been recent progress and we hope for a just and satisfactory resolution.
The conflict between Spain and the colonies has affected our country, but we have remained neutral and have not contributed to either side. Our ports have been open to both parties. If the colonies achieve independence, we do not seek any special advantages in trade and will treat them on equal terms with other nations.
Regarding our internal affairs, our revenue is strong and there will be a surplus for the next year. The payments into the Treasury have been substantial, allowing us to support the civil government, military and naval establishments, and even pay off some of the public debt.
Our armed forces are well-maintained, and we are making progress in extinguishing the Indian title to lands, which will allow for the expansion of settlements. We must also focus on the improvement and civilization of the Native inhabitants.
We should continue to support our manufactories, as they are important for our national interests. The public buildings, including the Capitol, are progressing, but more attention and funding are needed. The completion of the middle building is necessary for the accommodation of Congress.
Good roads and canals are essential for the development of our country, but the right to establish such a system of improvement does not currently belong to Congress. I recommend that an amendment to the Constitution be considered to grant Congress this right. It is also suggested that the states include in the amendment the right for Congress to establish seminaries of learning for the benefit of our citizens.
I urge Congress to provide for the surviving officers and soldiers of our Revolutionary army who are in need. Their contributions to our nation deserve our gratitude and support.
With our current revenue, we can repeal the internal taxes. Imposing taxes is a sacred duty, but we should only do so when necessary. We will continue to monitor the situation and if any future emergencies arise, I will not hesitate to recommend appropriate measures.

On the domestic front, the financial operations of the government have been successful, and efforts should be made to maintain a strong financial position through strict economy. The public debt remains a cause for concern, and measures should be taken to reduce it. The public money should be kept separately from the banks to prevent misuse, and the payment of public dues in gold and silver should be required. The government should cooperate with the states in reforming the banking system, and steps should be taken to eliminate abuses and promote the general welfare.

We have faced joy, tragedy, and achievements as a nation, but these moments have brought us closer together. We should remember the wonder of the first Christmas in Bethlehem, whether we celebrate it as the birth of a philosopher or as the divinity of the child. It is a time for us to care for one another, just as Jesus taught us.

The glow of the Christmas tree in homes across America represents the love Jesus taught us. Throughout history, Americans have followed a higher light, guided by faith and freedom. We may have faltered at times, but with God's help, we have never lost our way. The Menorah and National Christmas Tree symbolize the holiday season at the White House. Our country, like the tree, is a living thing that needs our care to flourish. This holiday season is a time for rededication.

While we rejoice, we must remember that not all Americans will have a happy Christmas. I know this feeling from my own experience during the Great Depression when my father lost his job. We are working hard on economic recovery and aim for a future where everyone who needs a job can get one. Our battle against inflation, government spending, and taxation will lead to more economic growth and opportunity.

Charles Dickens once said that we live in the best and worst of times, and this rings true today. The world is full of promise and peril, with people suffering from want and tyranny.

We cannot stand idly by while the Polish people suffer.

We have suspended economic relations with Poland as a warning to the government. We will still provide food to the Polish people, but only if it reaches them and not their oppressors. We have sent letters to General Jaruzelski and President Brezhnev urging them to restore human rights. If they continue to repress, we will take further measures. We stand in solidarity with the Polish people during this Christmas.

Christmas reminds us that freedom's light will not be extinguished. We are blessed with freedom and abundance, which come with an obligation to God, our heritage, and the children of the world. All children are special, gifts from God. In their love and laughter, we find the true meaning of Christmas. Nancy and I wish you a wonderful holiday season. God bless us all. Good night.",9.5,positive
"I, the President of the United States, address the Seneka Nation. I have received your Speech and appreciate your confidence in the United States. We desire to forget the miseries of war and promote friendship and justice. The sale of your lands can only be done through public treaties approved by the United States. We will protect your rights. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix secures your lands, and any fair sales authorized by your nation will be respected. If there are issues, the federal Courts can provide redress. The United States has a law to regulate trade and protect the Indians. We will provide assistance for farming. We condemn the murders committed by white men and will ensure the perpetrators are punished. We have been forced to take action against bad Indians who have been causing harm. We want to be friends based on justice and humanity, but we cannot tolerate the actions of bad Indians. Please warn your people against joining them. We appreciate the friendship of the Cornplanter and will reward him accordingly. An Agent will be appointed to represent the United States and you should approach them for any issues. Do not trust anyone who speaks negatively about the United States - they are your enemy. We will remain faithful to our promises.",7.5,positive
"To Congress: In order to effectively prosecute the war against Mexico, we need to increase the Regular Army and fix its organization. The Secretary of War recommends raising ten additional regiments of regular troops for the duration of the war. Some volunteer regiments have been raised, but not all due to delays caused by state governments. In times of peace, we strive to have a small Regular Army, but in war, we must increase its numbers to enhance overall efficiency. To address this, more officers are needed, especially in higher ranks. Many current officers are unable to actively serve, impacting the Army's effectiveness. It is necessary to appoint a general officer to command our military forces during this war, but they can be dispensed with once the war is over and the Army is reduced to a peace establishment. It is crucial for Congress to take early action on these recommendations to ensure active and efficient service before the favorable military season in the enemy's country passes.",5.0,negative
"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives,

I am deeply grateful for the support and approval of the public. Although I initially desired retirement, I accepted the call to resume the Executive power because I believed my conduct would be judged fairly and the people would support efforts for the general happiness. The war in Europe threatened our relations, so I issued a proclamation to clarify our legal status. I have allowed the sale of prizes to France but ensured they are returned if taken within our territory or by war-like vessels. Congress should improve this plan and expand the legal code and jurisdiction of the courts. Offenses committed within the United States against warring powers or violations of international law require swift attention and remedies. The judiciary is well-equipped to administer these remedies. The jurisdiction of the courts in certain situations should be regulated. The United States must be prepared for defense and demand fulfillment of duties from other nations to secure peace. Our connection with Europe is important and will be detailed in a subsequent communication. Efforts to negotiate peace with the Indians have been made, but military action may become necessary. Congress should determine if additional troops or militia are needed. Peace with the Indians can be achieved through strict justice and establishing commerce with them. Individuals must be allured by the hope of profit, and the United States need only be reimbursed. The commissioners have concluded their settlement of accounts and the balances have been placed on the books of the Treasury. A loan installment has been paid to Holland, and provision must be made for the second installment. The regular redemption of public debt is crucial, and auxiliary provisions may be necessary. I recommend the repeal of the tax on transportation of public prints. An estimate of appropriations and a statement of arms and military stores purchased during the recess will be presented. The subjects I have mentioned are of great importance, and I urge you to approach them with unbiased deliberation and cooperation for the welfare of our country.",4.0,negative

We have also taken steps towards peaceful relations with France and the island of St. Domingo. Unfortunately, there have been disagreements with Britain regarding the interpretation of a treaty, but we hope for satisfactory explanations. The seat of government will be transferred to Washington, and I invite you to investigate public expenditure for beneficial retrenchments. In this uncertain time, we must maintain our national defense and protect our country's rights.

I encourage you to continue your travels to the cities on the coast where you have many friends. I invite you to visit Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York.

"To Congress: I am sharing a correspondence between Hawaiian agents and the Secretary of State. The Hawaiian Islands, located in the Pacific Ocean, are becoming more civilized and competent in governance. They are crucial for refueling and supplying American and European ships. The United States has a strong presence in the islands due to their strategic location and the large number of American vessels engaged in the whale fishery. The Hawaiian Government is just emerging from barbarism and seeks to improve the lives of its people through education and the arts. The US, along with other commercial states, should respect and protect the rights of the Hawaiian community. The US should also be wary of any attempt by another power to colonize the islands. I recommend providing a moderate allowance to the consul residing in Hawaii for the protection of American citizens and property. In China, military operations by the British have concluded with a treaty that opens four important ports to British merchants. It is important for the US to determine if these ports will also be open to American commerce. The US imports a significant amount of goods from China, and its exports to China are growing. Although China has a history of excluding foreigners, events are likely to change this. China has agreed to equal correspondence with England, and it is probable that other nations will seek the same. While the demand for foreign goods in China may not be huge, the opening of new ports would increase this demand. It is unlikely that embassies will be established between England and China, but the US should appoint a commissioner to watch over American interests and engage with the local authorities. The commissioner should be a highly qualified individual and should receive appropriate compensation.",6.5,positive
"Today, I want to discuss the tragedy in Somalia and the mission to ease suffering and save lives. The scale of suffering in Somalia is unimaginable, with a quarter-million people already dead and the potential for 1.5 million more deaths. The United States has been actively involved in relief efforts, sending 200,000 tons of food, the majority of the world's total. However, the distribution system broke down, preventing food from reaching those in need. In response, the U.S. Air Force and U.N. guards were deployed to fly food and protect the operation, but the security situation worsened. Food aid was looted, convoys were hijacked, and aid workers were assaulted. With no government or law and order, anarchy prevails. Relief groups called for military support to ensure the safe delivery of food. The United States offered to lead a coalition to help, and a substantial American force is being sent to Somalia. The mission, called Operation Restore Hope, aims to create a secure environment for food delivery, after which troops will be withdrawn and U.N. peacekeeping forces will take over. The mission is purely humanitarian, with the objective of feeding the starving people of Somalia. The U.S. and coalition partners will not tolerate armed gangs looting food and condemning people to starvation. The mission will be accomplished, and once it is completed, the U.S. will not remain with fighting forces in Somalia. It is important to respect Somalia's sovereignty and independence. This is a difficult and dangerous job for the armed forces, but they will have full support from the Commander in Chief and will be brought home as soon as possible. To the families of those involved, their mission is in the finest traditions of service. God bless the United States of America.",8.0,positive
"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I have important news regarding our foreign relations. The act passed by Congress on commercial intercourse with Britain and France led to the revocation of the Berlin and Milan decrees by the French Government. However, France has not addressed our other grievances. The British Government has not communicated with us about the act. On the subject of blockades, the British may also reconsider their position. We have not made progress in other important matters. Concerning trade with North Europe, Danish cruisers have been causing problems, and we are considering further action. We have taken control of West Florida to protect our interests. Our relations with the Barbary powers and Indian tribes remain stable. Our country is prospering, with improvements in agriculture and manufacturing. We should consider regulations to support our navigation and protect our markets. We should also establish a national institution of learning to promote unity and knowledge. Congress should address the issue of American citizens engaging in the slave trade.

"Gentlemen of the Congress: I will continue the practice of reporting to you on matters of general public policy. There are some important measures left unfinished from the last session that need immediate attention. These include enlarging and reorganizing the Interstate Commerce Commission, establishing an eight-hour workday for railway employees, appointing a commission to observe the effects of the eight-hour day, approving an increase in freight rates to offset costs, amending the mediation and arbitration statute, and granting the Executive the power to control railways in times of military necessity. The Congress has already taken action on the second and third recommendations, but the others still need consideration. It is urgent that these actions are taken to ensure the efficiency and regulation of the public service. Furthermore, there are three important bills awaiting action in the Senate: one regarding freedom of combination in promoting foreign commerce, one amending the law of Porto Rico, and one for the regulation of money expenditure in elections. It is crucial that these bills are passed to protect the interests of the country and the government. Additionally, a bill for vocational and industrial education is of vital importance and should be enacted into law.

"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:

Prior to the transfer of Louisiana from France to the United States, Spain had committed depredations on our commerce during the war. We sought indemnification for our citizens, resulting in a convention with Spain. However, Spain's conduct changed after the Louisiana Purchase. We appointed James Monroe to repair relations and secure ratification of the convention, but Spain's policy seemed to be to keep our differences unresolved. After five months of unsuccessful negotiations, our ministers were unable to obtain indemnity or resolution on the boundaries of Louisiana. In response, Spain has chosen to advance on our possessions. I have chosen to await Congress's authority before using force. I have instructed our officers to protect our citizens within our borders and required Spanish officers to depart New Orleans promptly. France has expressed support for our demands on Spain regarding French spoliations. The current situation in Europe presents an opportunity for a settlement, and we must act swiftly. I will follow Congress's guidance and provide them with all necessary information. Our citizens deserve protection, and we must assert our honor.

"To the House of Representatives:

I must address the issue of internal improvement once again in relation to my objections to the bill titled ""An act for the improvement of certain harbors and the navigation of certain rivers."" I did not have enough time to review the bill before it was adjourned, but upon careful consideration, I have decided to withhold my signature as some of its provisions go against the guidelines I follow when considering such legislation. I have attached a report from the Engineer Department to assist Congress in understanding which appropriations align with these guidelines and which do not. There are appropriations in the bill for the improvement of non-navigable streams and do not relate to designated harbors or ports of entry. These appropriations imply that the government has unlimited power over internal improvements, which contradicts my previous actions on the matter. Although the classification of improvements in this bill may not always be clear, I will continue to do my best to apply and enforce my guidelines. I trust in your cooperation and understanding as we work towards the betterment of our country. If the bill had only included provisions for lighthouses, beacons, buoys, public piers, and the removal of temporary river impediments, I would have gladly signed it.",4.3,negative
"Gentlemen of Congress, I address you today with the belief that right makes might and that we must dare to do our duty. This sentiment, immortalized by Abraham Lincoln, embodies the essence of our nation. It is through this faith that we can lift the world out of its present confusion and despair.

Democracy, founded upon this faith, asserts the right of the individual to be treated justly and equally. We must lead by example, ensuring that our laws protect the rights of all and promote the development of industry and necessary wealth. Furthermore, we must stand for right and justice towards other nations, protecting the weak and supporting their recognition and privilege.

To achieve this, we must practice domestic and international economy, revise our tax laws, and simplify income and profits taxes. We must also provide adequate care and treatment for our disabled veterans and grant independence to the Philippine Islands.

In conclusion, it is through our faith and action that we can uphold the principles of democracy and bring about victories for our nation and the world.",6.5,positive

It was a long road, but through patience and determination, we have made this vision a reality. This agreement will eliminate a class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles, resulting in the removal of over 1,500 deployed warheads on the Soviet side and the destruction of all ground-launched intermediate-range missiles. On our side, we will destroy our entire complement of Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles. Trust, but verify, is a principle that guided us in creating this agreement, which includes a stringent verification regime. This treaty also promotes glasnost in military programs and forces.

I also want to acknowledge Laura Tyson, Bob Rubin, and Congressman David Dreier for their contributions. I am thankful for the hard work of our Cabinet members and the support from citizens, business leaders, labor groups, and environmental activists.

I want to mention the significant role that the military played in supporting NAFTA. Their experience and understanding of global affairs contributed to their strong support. I am personally moved by their remarks.

I want to express my appreciation to Bill Daley and Congressman Bill Frenzel for their support and efforts. They exemplified the bipartisan spirit that was present throughout this campaign.

NAFTA is a defining moment for our nation and a symbolic struggle for how we approach a rapidly changing world. Ratifying NAFTA allows us to create an economic order that promotes growth, equality, environmental preservation, and world peace. This decision signifies our commitment to competing rather than retreating.

NAFTA will remove trade barriers and create the largest trade zone, resulting in the creation of 200,000 jobs by 1995 alone. Additionally, the environmental and labor side agreements will promote social progress along with economic growth.

The success of NAFTA has already inspired progress towards a worldwide trade agreement that could have even greater benefits. Now is the time to seize the opportunity and close the deal on a strong GATT agreement.

We must recognize that the global economy is the central fact of life for hard-working Americans, and we cannot stop global change. We must export to find new customers and create a new trading system that benefits all nations while protecting our middle class.

Our goals must include ensuring trade promotes environmental preservation, securing workers' rights, and guaranteeing fair treatment for our businesses. We must also focus on providing personal security and job retraining opportunities to confidently participate in this new era.

Let us seek to reconstruct the coalition for expanded trade by addressing the concerns of those who opposed NAFTA and enforcing the labor and side agreements. We must work together to create the world's best worker training and retraining system.

A new and open global trading system is necessary for our own prosperity. We must face the challenges with confidence, deal with problems honestly, and make this world work for all of us. America is ready to compete and win.

"In response to the request of the House of Representatives, I am providing information on the effectiveness of gun-boats in harbor defense and the proposed distribution of these boats in the United States. It has been concluded that a combination of land batteries, movable artillery, floating batteries, and gun-boats would be necessary to protect our harbors. Professional opinions, including those of General Wilkinson, General Gates, Commodore Barron, and Captain Tingey, support this system. Gun-boats are commonly used by maritime nations for defense, and their efficacy can be seen in their successful use by Algiers and during the attack and defense of Gibraltar. In Europe, northern powers and Russia have also used gun-boats effectively. Around 200 gun-boats would be required to protect our seaports, with a proposed distribution as follows: 40 for the Mississippi and neighboring waters, 25 for Savannah and Charleston, 20 for the Chesapeake and its waters, 15 for Delaware Bay and River, 50 for New York and the Sound, and 50 for Boston and the harbors north of Cape Cod. These gun-boats would be under the command of a specific commandant for each station. About half of the necessary gun-boats have already been built or are under construction, and the remaining boats would cost around five to six hundred thousand dollars. The legislature can determine if more gun-boats are needed or if the current number is sufficient. During peacetime, only a small number of gun-boats would be kept active, but during war, a larger number may be necessary to maintain order in harbors frequented by foreign vessels of war. The unused gun-boats would be stored in safe locations and require minimal upkeep. It is important to note that these gun-boats are for defense purposes only and would have little effect on protecting our commerce in open seas or engaging in offensive maritime war.",5.0,negative

Correspondence between the governor of Maine and the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick indicates a disagreement regarding jurisdiction over the disputed territory. Both parties have tried to avoid conflict and negotiate a settlement. Maine has the right to intervene to prevent further destruction, but occupying the territory militarily is different and the federal government cannot use military force to assist Maine. If New Brunswick attempts a military occupation, the federal government has the right to aid Maine. I have expressed hope for the release of the agents and recommended the disbanding of the militia.

Our countrymen have always shown kindness and generosity towards each other in times of misfortune, and I believe they will continue to do so. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Agriculture already has a budget for seed distribution, and if Senators and Representatives requested their shares of grain to be sent to Texas, it would help the farmers without causing undue hardship to their constituents.",5.0,negative

Peace is welcome now that the causes for war have ended and the government demonstrated its defense capability. I commend the military for their bravery and recommend supporting them. Public spending should be reduced, but preparation for future conflicts is important. Peace will bring prosperity and the revival of commerce. We must protect and promote our domestic industries.

Furthermore, I bring attention to the issue of American vessels and property being confiscated in South American countries during civil unrest. Other countries have the power to enforce immediate redress, but the United States does not. The remedy for this can only come from Congress, as they have the power to make war. I advise Congress to grant the President limited authority to protect American citizens and property in specific cases. This should not be seen as a transfer of war-making power, but as an appropriate exercise of it. I warn that without this authority, the President may be placed in a precarious position. I trust Congress to make the right decision for the country.",6.5,positive
"I am sending to the United States Senate and House of Representatives copies of dispatches received from our envoy, Mr. Wise, regarding the slave trade. It is regrettable that some of our citizens are cooperating with other powers to evade our laws. American vessels are being chartered or purchased by slave dealers in Brazil, with the knowledge of the owners, and used to transport slaves. The vessel is chartered to Great Britain, where it is loaded with merchandise for the African trade. A new crew is put on board in Brazil, and on the coast of Africa, the slaves are exchanged for the merchandise. The American crew is discharged and the new crew returns with the slaves to Brazil. British factors and agents are also involved in this trade and abuse the American flag. We should consider the suggestions made by Mr. Wise to the British envoy on how to stop this trade. We should also review our existing measures to ensure they are effective. It is unfortunate that Britain does not have the same policy as us in providing for the comfortable support of slaves after their restoration. Their current policy supports the continuation of the trade. It is difficult to suppress the trade with such large interests involved. We must hope that Britain will adopt more efficient measures to suppress the trade and restore captured Africans to their homes.",4.5,negative

"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Secretary:

I appreciate the opportunity to be here and thank you all for attending. I asked physically fit members of the Cabinet to join today, and I am glad that Mr. Udall, Mr. Robert Kennedy, and Governor Ribicoff responded. In the past, President Roosevelt rode a horse for a hundred miles to prove his fitness, but we don't need such demonstrations now. We expect all members of the administration to be physically fit, and that's why we're here, to encourage all of you in your work. Since the ancient Greeks, we have believed in the connection between a strong mind and physical fitness. We hope to promote this spirit among Americans, encouraging their personal development. We want an active nation, not spectators. This starts with each family and community's involvement and is not solely settled by Washington. We want mothers, fathers, boys, girls, and adults to engage in physical activities. We aim to create a program with your support that inspires the nation. We should place more emphasis on physical health, as we have fallen behind other countries. We want to preserve our national character and vitality. We value your suggestions and ideas, as this is a two-way flow of communication. Teachers from different countries contribute to our understanding, and we learn from them. I hope they share our efforts when they return. We aspire to establish a Peace Corps, and young men and women who desire to serve America and freedom have responded positively. I hope teaching becomes their priority, as they will gain as much as they teach. This will connect us to the world. I thank you all, regardless of where you come from. We are all united in this endeavor, and we in Washington are committed to your work.

Thank you.",6.9,positive
"Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, today as we gather in this esteemed institution, we pay tribute to President Lopez Mateos. His intellect and compassion have made him an exemplary leader, and Mexico's commitment to education is evident in its appeal to students from all over the world.

The University of California, like other prestigious American universities, is dedicated to enriching and diversifying American life. We take pride in our enduring friendship with Mexico and our shared history of fighting for independence, strengthening institutions, and pursuing social justice.

We recognize that there is still work to be done. As long as there are people without jobs, homes, or education, our mission continues. We cannot rest until all Americans enjoy their rights and no one is neglected or discriminated against.

In our foreign policy, we remain unwavering in our pursuit of peace. The world has become more volatile, and we face daily challenges at our doorstep. We stand committed to supporting the people of South Viet-Nam in their fight against external aggression.

In Cyprus, a tragic conflict between communities threatens to escalate. While the United States may not be directly involved, we will do everything we can to seek a peaceful solution. Statesmanship must prevail to prevent disaster.

Closer to home, we seek fairness and cooperation in our discussions with Panama. We are committed to finding prompt solutions to our shared problems and strengthening our partnership.

At Guantanamo, we handle provocations with caution and without undue military force. Our base is secure, and we continue to prioritize peace over aggression.

While we face various dangers and challenges, we should not solely rely on headlines to dictate our actions. The global community of freedom is growing stronger, and we must remain united in our commitment to liberty.

In this hemisphere, as we work on the Alliance for Progress, we welcome European friends who offer support and market opportunities. We seek partnerships and will fulfill our obligations to allies. We do not fear intimidation from any state that chooses to be our adversary, but we prioritize peace and respond swiftly to offers of peaceful deeds.

We will continue to support Ukraine and remain united. Russia's aggression must be opposed. Despite their brutality, Ukraine remains free. The world stands with Ukraine. We have provided support and will continue to do so. Russia's war is a tragedy, but we will hold them accountable. We are proud of our achievements over the past year, but we must remain vigilant. Ukraine will defend itself, and the United States remains committed to NATO and Article 5. We must work together to build a better world, promoting health, prosperity, peace, and dignity.

"Gentlemen of the Congress: I am here to address you in these critical times to ensure unity between the Houses of Congress. On February 3rd, I informed you of the German Government's decision to disregard its promises and conduct unrestricted submarine operations. This policy has been in execution for four weeks, resulting in severe damage to neutral nations' commerce. Our own commerce has been affected due to fear, rather than actual sinkings. The Housatonic and Lyman M. Law were sunk, with the latter showing ruthlessness. The situation remains the same, with our ships tied up in ports. There have been indications that our ships and people may be spared due to fortunate circumstances, rather than adherence to instructions. The situation is dangerous and we must be prepared to take action. The current Congress is about to expire, so I request your immediate assurance of authority to act. I believe armed neutrality may be necessary, but I hope it can be avoided. I assure you that I am the friend of peace and desire to preserve it. I request your authorization to supply defensive arms to our merchant ships and provide other means of protection. I also request the necessary credit for insurance against war risks. My main concern is the fundamental human rights, including the right to life. We must defend these rights and principles of justice.",3.7,negative
"I am returning H.R. 17054, ""An Act to increase the loan basis of adjusted service certificates,"" without my approval. The adjusted compensation act, passed in 1924, provided $1.365 billion in compensation for war service to 3.5 million veterans. The outstanding certificates now total $3.426 billion held by 3.4 million veterans. This bill proposes to increase the loan rate to 50% of the face value, potentially costing the government $1.7 billion. 
The argument for reopening the bonus act is based on providing funds to veterans in need due to the drought and business depression. However, there are already measures in place to support veterans in need, and the number of veterans requiring this assistance is relatively small. 
The proposed benefits would also go to veterans who are already receiving support from the government or who have secure jobs. It is argued that this would stimulate the economy, but it would actually burden the government with more borrowing and increase interest rates. This would ultimately hurt the economy and the American people.
I believe it is important to honor and support veterans who are in need, but this bill goes against the principle of self-reliance and would burden the nation with unnecessary costs. It is best to administer the government with the well-being of all in mind, including veterans.",4.0,negative

"I present to Congress a letter from the agent of the United States with the Creek Indians, who seek protection in defense of their rights and territory as guaranteed by the treaty. It has been confirmed that surveyors from Georgia have trespassed on Indian lands, potentially leading to violence. The law states that those who settle, survey, or designate boundaries on Indian lands can be fined and imprisoned. There are two processes through which this can be enforced: apprehending the offender in the Indian country or arresting them within the United States. In this case, I have chosen to pursue the civil process and have instructed the attorney and marshal of Georgia to prosecute the surveyors. The Indians have been assured of their rights and urged to avoid hostility. The choice to avoid military force was made to prevent conflict with Georgia's military. However, Georgia's actions are a violation of the treaty and the supreme law of the land. If they continue to encroach on Indian territories and the Union's laws remain unchanged, I may be compelled to use military force to enforce the law. Congress should decide if further legislation is needed to address this situation.",6.0,positive

It took 8 years and two vetoes to make it law, but now millions of people won't have to choose between their jobs and their families. This bill will strengthen families, businesses, and the economy. Employers and employees are more productive when they have job security, and the most successful companies prioritize their employees. This law is common sense and will provide peace of mind. Going forward, we must continue to prioritize the public interest and pass a budget that grows the economy and reduces the deficit. We also need to help those on welfare find work and independence, strengthen child support enforcement, and provide support for working parents. Let's set aside partisan interests and be inspired by this victory to continue working for the benefit of our families and our nation. Thank you.",9.0,positive
"The union of the States of Germany into a government similar to that of the American Union is deeply appreciated by the United States.

Germany now has a population of 34 million united under one government, but with control over their local interests. It is believed that bringing together such a large number of people under a single government will make governments more representative of the will of the people. The adoption of the American system in Europe is expected to extend popular institutions and spread American ideas. The relationship between the United States and Germany is close and growing, with extensive commercial and personal interactions. The importance of the German mission warrants equal treatment with the missions in Great Britain and France.

"Thank you all for being here today. We have gathered to commemorate the signing of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a plan that will create or save 3.5 million jobs and provide relief for struggling families. This act is the largest economic recovery package in our history and has received support from a wide range of groups and individuals, including Democrats and Republicans. It will invest in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and renewable energy. It also includes tax cuts that will benefit the middle class and lift two million Americans out of poverty. We understand the responsibility that comes with such a large investment, and we will ensure that the money is spent wisely and transparently. This is just the beginning of our efforts to address our economic crisis, and we will continue working to stabilize our banking system, prevent foreclosures, and restore fiscal discipline. The road to recovery will not be easy, but if we continue to do the necessary work, we will emerge stronger than before. Thank you, and let's get to work.",8.0,positive
"To the House of Representatives: After careful consideration of House bill No. 1093, ""An act to authorize the coinage of the standard silver dollar and to restore its legal-tender character,"" I must return it with objections. I believe in maintaining silver as one of the precious metals in coinage, but this bill does not meet the necessary requirements. The silver dollar it proposes is worth 8 to 10% less than its nominal value and is made a legal tender for debts when it was not recognized as lawful money. Paying duties in silver will end revenue in gold and force payment of silver for the public debt. The sale of bonds was based on payment in gold, and it would be a breach of faith to pay them in silver now worth less. The bill has no provision protecting preexisting debts from its operation. If it intends to take advantage of silver's depreciation to pay debts, it would be seen as an act of bad faith. Silver should only be a legal tender for preexisting debts at its market value. It is my conviction that a beneficial silver coinage should have full value to avoid defrauding creditors and those engaged in legitimate business.",5.5,positive
"To the Congress of the United States:
I am addressing you today regarding our financial condition and the need for legislation to protect our national welfare and credit. Unfortunately, there is still anxiety and apprehension in business circles, and the current legislative situation does not look promising. As a precaution, we have made preparations to utilize Executive authority to strengthen our Treasury's gold reserve.

Under section 3700 of the Revised Statutes, we have arranged for the issuance of bonds to purchase gold coin. These bonds, authorized under the act of July 14, 1875, amount to just under $62,400,000, while the gold being acquired exceeds $65,000,000. Combining this with our existing gold reserve, we will have over $100,000,000 in total. The Government will receive a premium on the bonds, setting the interest rate on the gold obtained at 3 3/4 percent per annum. It is important to note that at least half of the gold will be sourced from abroad.

We have also secured the privilege to replace the 4 percent coin bonds with 3 percent gold bonds, should Congress authorize their issuance within ten days. This arrangement, after extensive evaluation, provides the best outcomes in our current circumstances. Investors value bonds payable in gold more than those payable in coin, leading to a 0.75 cent difference in annual interest. The potential annual savings, if we substitute the bonds, will amount to $539,159, reaching $16,174,770 over thirty years.

It is paramount that there is no doubt about the government's commitment to redeem bonds payable in coin with gold. The preference of investors for gold bonds is beyond our control but holds great significance. The sentiments of those with whom we negotiate cannot be disregarded.

I believe this detailed transaction surpasses previous efforts in effectively bolstering our gold reserve through bond sales. It aligns with the goal expressed in the law repealing the silver-purchasing clause of the act of July 14, 1890, and supports maintaining the value parity of coins and the equal power of every dollar.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

[Condensed: Although anxiety and apprehension continues in the business world, the current legislative situation does not appear promising, so preparations have been made to use Executive authority to strengthen the gold reserve. Bonds will be issued to purchase gold, some of which will be sourced from abroad. The Government has secured the option to replace the bonds with 3 percent gold bonds if authorized by Congress. This arrangement offers cost savings and better results than previous attempts. The sentiments of investors favor bonds payable in gold. The transaction aligns with the goal expressed in the repeal of the silver-purchasing clause to maintain the value parity of coins.]

Everyone has the right to peaceful protest, but violence and lawbreaking are unacceptable. Federal agencies are mobilized to maintain order. We will get through this challenge together.

"Senate bill No. 1044, ""to provide for the resumption of specie payments,"" has received my signature of approval. This law is significant and suggests the need for further legislation. I recommend an increase in revenue to meet the obligations of the sinking fund and the redemption of legal-tenders and fractional currency. One suggestion is to restore the duty on tea and coffee without increasing costs for consumers. Additionally, the provision to redeem fractional currency in silver coin may cause issues with fluctuation and potential hoarding. To address this, I propose authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem legal-tender notes at a premium for gold, gradually decreasing the premium until final resumption. This would ensure the retention of silver in the country. The third section of the act will prevent the Treasury from being exhausted. Furthermore, the country may require another mint to coin the necessary silver for transactions. This could be established in cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, or Omaha to reduce transportation expenses. I present these suggestions with the understanding that they require further discussion and consideration to benefit the nation's interests and prosperity.",7.0,positive
"In a few days, I will leave the presidency and become a citizen once again. I am grateful to Vice President Mondale, my Cabinet, and everyone who has served our country. But my deepest thanks go to the American people for giving me this incredible opportunity. We have faced challenges together, and I am now more convinced than ever that the United States can overcome anything. These last four years have shown me the strength of our country, the value of our principles, the stability of our system, and the decency of our people. 

The presidency is a powerful but constrained office. The president must lead with the support and consent of the people through Congress and various institutions. Every American has the right and duty to shape the future of our nation. Thoughtful criticism and scrutiny are important in our democratic society. It is crucial that we maintain a strong presidency with its constitutional authority intact. The president represents all the people and must speak for the nation in decision-making moments. 

The new president-elect faces a formidable task, and I pledge my support to him. I know from experience that presidents must tackle controversial issues that do not have widespread support. Now, I want to address three difficult issues: the threat of nuclear destruction, the stewardship of our planet's resources, and the importance of human rights. 

The risk of a nuclear war has not decreased. With the growth of nuclear arsenals around the world, it's only a matter of time before this destructive force is unleashed. A nuclear war would cause unparalleled destruction and despair. We must control and reduce the stockpiles of nuclear arms to avoid catastrophe. 

We must also protect the planet we call home. The depletion of resources, erosion, pollution, and overpopulation pose significant challenges. However, we can tackle these problems with courage and foresight. 

In addition to these challenges, we must always fight for human rights. The struggle for freedom and justice transcends differences of race, religion, and nationality. America must continue to stand for these rights both at home and abroad. 

We live in a time of transition and tension. It may be tempting to abandon our values, but we must never yield to this temptation. Our American values are necessities, not luxuries. Democracy is an unfinished creation, and each generation must renew its foundations.

To counteract this, we should encourage them to pursue agriculture and domestic activities, and establish more trading houses to provide them with necessary comforts. This will ultimately lead to their participation in our government. Our trading houses have successfully competed with private traders, benefiting both the Indians and ourselves. It would be beneficial to have a respectable presence on the Mississippi, particularly with the Chickasaw tribe, as it is important for our safety. It would be wise for us to explore the Missouri River and its tribes for potential commerce, as it could surpass the trade of another nation.

During this transformative period, you have risen to every challenge, strengthening our social fabric, improving the lives of our families, and prospering as a nation. Together, we have embraced the global information age and experienced a great American renewal.

Throughout my presidency, my decisions, actions, and proposed bills have aimed to provide all Americans with the tools and conditions to build a future of prosperity, with focus on economic strength, environmental sustainability, and individual freedom.

Through our collective efforts, the American people have achieved significant accomplishments. Our economy has reached record-breaking levels, with 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, and the highest homeownership rates ever. We have made progress in strengthening families and communities, with millions benefiting from family leave and moving off welfare. Crime rates are at a 25-year low, and millions have received college aid and healthcare coverage. Income levels have risen, and our environment is cleaner than ever before.

Furthermore, America has exerted its influence as a force for peace and prosperity worldwide, with strong alliances and a commitment to promoting freedom and security. We must continue to lead globally, as our security and prosperity depend on it. While the global economy brings opportunities, it also exposes us to destructive forces like terrorism, organized crime, and environmental degradation. We must combat global poverty and fulfill our shared responsibility to create a better world.

Lastly, as our nation becomes more diverse, we must actively work towards unity and embrace our common values and humanity. We must treat all individuals fairly and respectfully, regardless of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. By doing so, we can build upon the vision of our founding fathers and strive for a more perfect union.

We are facing a supreme test of courage, wisdom, and our democracy. If we pass this test, we will serve a historic cause that will be honored forever.

As I stand here today, having taken the solemn oath of office, I know it is America's purpose not to fail.

In the future, we will work for a just and honorable peace, while also pursuing total victory in war.

We will strive for perfection, knowing we may make mistakes, but they must not come from weakness or abandonment of moral principles.

Our Constitution of 1787 was not perfect, but it provided a foundation for all people to build our democratic structure.

In this year of war, we have learned valuable lessons at a great cost. We cannot live alone, but rather as citizens of the world.

We have learned that trust, understanding, and courage are essential for lasting peace.

God has blessed our land and given us the strength to fight for freedom and truth. We pray for vision to lead us towards a better life for all and His will for peace on earth.",7.5,positive
"I accept the honor with humility and commit to working for the welfare of our nation and world peace. I need the support and prayers of everyone. The challenges we face are momentous, but by working together, we can overcome them. We are at a turning point in human history and must learn to live together in peace. The world looks to the United States for leadership.

We believe in equal justice, freedom of thought, and equality for all. Our goal is a world where every nation can govern themselves and achieve a decent life. We are opposed by a regime with a different ideology – communism. Communism believes man is weak and needs strong masters, while democracy believes man can govern himself. Communism suppresses individual rights, promotes violence, and leads to division. Democracy promotes peace, justice, and unity.

These differences affect the whole world. It's about material well-being, human dignity, and the right to believe and worship. The actions of communism threaten world recovery and lasting peace. We have invested in restoring peace and freedom after the war. We support the United Nations, economic recovery, and free nations against aggression. We must also help underdeveloped areas with technology and capital investment.

This should be a cooperative effort with all nations working together through the United Nations. We can raise living standards by increasing production and applying scientific knowledge. Democracy is the force that can overcome oppression, hunger, and despair. We must maintain our prosperity and strength to succeed in these policies. We are creating a world of international security and growing prosperity.

We are aided by those who desire freedom, truth, self-government, and economic security. Our allies are those who long for righteousness. As more nations experience the benefits of democracy, I believe our opponents will join us in settling international differences. Our democracy is tested, but we will surpass our achievements in liberty. With God's help, we will build a world of justice, harmony, and peace.",8.0,positive
"Friends, let us pray for guidance from God as we begin this important moment. May we be dedicated to serving the people and upholding the laws of this land, without discrimination. Let cooperation be our goal, regardless of political beliefs, for the good of our country. We are living in a time of challenge, with forces of good and evil in opposition. Today, we witness the act of one citizen taking an oath of service, but we are also called to show the world that we believe in a future that belongs to the free. Throughout history, nations have gone through trials, and our country is no exception. We have overcome depression and war to reach a peak in our history, but we still seek to understand the significance of the times we live in. We ask for God's guidance in our quest for knowledge and a better future. We must ask ourselves how far we have come as a society toward progress and freedom, and whether we are moving towards the light or into darkness. Our faith in the dignity of humanity and the belief in equal rights define our way of life. We elect leaders to serve, not to rule, and we value virtues like truth, work, and devotion to country. Every person contributes to the success of our nation, from the laborers to the statesmen. Our faith in these principles ensures that the changes we are making today are not disruptive, but rather a renewal of our commitment to our country. Those who oppose our faith in freedom rely on force, treachery, and the suppression of truth. This conflict goes beyond different political ideologies; it threatens our way of life. We must understand that unity is the strength of all free people, while discord is their weakness. As the leader of the free world, it is our responsibility to protect the freedom of all peoples and to distinguish between leadership and imperialism. We face threats with confidence because we are not prisoners of history, but free men who have a steadfast faith. We are committed to peace but recognize the importance of strength to deter aggression. We are willing to work with other nations to reduce armaments and eliminate mutual fear and distrust. Appeasement is futile, and we will never compromise our honor for security. The strength and security of our nation is a duty that requires sacrifice from all citizens. We respect and honor the heritage of other nations and strive to help them achieve their own security and well-being. We recognize the importance of economic health to military strength and peace, and we will foster policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade. We believe in regional groupings of free nations and will work within the United Nations to strengthen these bonds. In our own hemisphere, we are dedicated to building trust among all nations. In Europe, we encourage unity among Western nations to protect their heritage. We view all continents and peoples as equal and reject the notion of any race or people being inferior or expendable. We believe in the United Nations as a force for peace and will strive to make it effective. These principles guide our actions, and we hope to be known by them. By following these principles, we can achieve an earth of peace. This aspiration must guide our way of life, and we must be ready to defend our country and make sacrifices for its sake. We must value our principles over privileges and understand that our strength lies in the productivity and commitment of every citizen. We must act wisely and with compassion, for what we hope to bring to the world must first be practiced in our own hearts and within our own country. The peace we seek is not just an absence of war, but a way of life and a hope for the brave. Thank you, my fellow citizens.",6.0,positive
"Today we celebrate not a partisan victory, but freedom itself. The world has changed greatly, yet the belief in the rights of man remains. We must remember that we are the heirs of the first revolution and pass the torch to a new generation who will protect human rights. We are committed to ensuring liberty's survival and success, willing to pay any price and bear any burden. We pledge our loyalty to old allies and welcome new states to the free world. We vow to assist those struggling with poverty, not for political gain, but because it is right. We offer a special pledge to our neighbors in the south to fight against aggression or subversion. We renew our support for the United Nations and its mission for peace. We request that our adversaries seek peace, not destruction. We must negotiate without fear and focus on common problems. Let us harness the power of science and explore new frontiers. Together, we can create a new world of justice, security, and peace. This will take time, but we must begin. The success or failure of our course rests in the hands of the people. We are called to defend freedom, battling tyranny, poverty, disease, and war. Can we form a global alliance for a better life? I welcome the responsibility and believe in the energy and devotion of our people. Let us ask not what our country can do for us, but what we can do for our country and for the freedom of all mankind. Let us hold ourselves to the same high standards that we ask of others. With a clear conscience and the judgment of history, let us go forth, seeking God's blessing and doing His work.",9.3,positive
"My fellow countrymen,

The oath I have taken is not mine alone, but ours together. We are one nation and our fate rests upon all citizens. The rocket heading towards Mars reminds us of the rapid and fantastic change we face. Our destiny relies on the character of our people and their faith.

Justice is the promise that all who come here share in the fruits of the land. Poverty, hunger, and suffering should not exist in a land so rich. For over 30 years, I have fought against this injustice and I know it will not surrender easily. But change has given us new weapons and we will conquer this enemy.

Liberty is self-government and the freedom for each person to be themselves. It has become more difficult in a world beyond our control, but we must provide the knowledge and surroundings for every citizen to thrive.

Our goal is to show the world the way to liberation. No stranger is outside our hope. We can seek our happiness in our own way and seek man's dominion over tyranny and misery.

Our nation's course is clear. We aspire to nothing that belongs to others and we reject division and hatred. Let us join reason to faith and action to experience to achieve progress without strife or hatred.

Under the covenant of justice, liberty, and union, we have become a great nation. But our greatness is not promised. If we succeed, it will be because of what we believe, not what we have.

We are a nation of believers in justice, liberty, and our union. We believe in the freedom of every man. And this belief has brought us victory in times of hardship. America is about the uncharted, the unreached, and the untapped. We say farewell to the old world and welcome the new one, shaping it to the hopes of humanity.

I will lead and do my best, but you must also look within your hearts to the old promises and dreams. For myself, I ask for wisdom and knowledge to serve this great nation.",7.5,positive
"Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice President Humphrey, my fellow Americans--and my fellow citizens of the world community:

I ask you to share with me today the significance of this moment. In the transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that preserves our freedom.

This is a pivotal moment in history, where the convergence of forces allows us to realize man's deepest aspirations. The rapid pace of change enables us to achieve advances in our lifetime that once took centuries.

By exploring space, we have discovered new horizons on earth.

For the first time, peace is favored by the people and feared by the leaders of the world.

In eight years, America will commemorate its 200th anniversary as a nation. In the lifetime of most people today, mankind will celebrate the third millennium.

The nation we become, the world we live in, and whether we shape the future according to our hopes, is up to us and the choices we make.

The greatest honor in history is to be a peacemaker. Now, America has the chance to help lead the world out of turmoil and into a peaceful future that has been dreamt of since civilization began.

If we succeed, future generations will say that we mastered our time and made the world safe for all mankind.

This is a call to greatness that I believe the American people are ready to answer.

The second third of this century has seen great achievements. We have made significant progress in science, industry, and agriculture. We have shared wealth more widely than ever before. We have learned to manage our economy for continued growth.

We have expanded freedom and made it a reality for both black and white.

The youth of today give us hope for tomorrow. They are well-educated, committed, and driven by conscience like no generation before.

No other people have come as close to achieving a just and prosperous society as we have. However, we must acknowledge our weaknesses and address them with hope.

We have come far materially but have fallen into discord and lost our spirit.

We are in a state of war but desire peace. We are divided and seek unity. We see emptiness and want fulfillment. We have tasks waiting for us.

In this crisis of the spirit, we need a spiritual response.

The answer lies within us when we listen to the better parts of our nature: goodness, decency, love, and kindness.

Greatness does not require extravagance.

Today, we need the simplicity of values and actions that can bridge our divisions and strengthen our unity.

We must lower our voices and speak quietly enough for our words to be heard.

Government will listen and find new ways to listen to the voices of those suffering, the voices of the heart, the unheard voices.

We will strive to include those who have been left out and help those who have been left behind.

Our goal is to establish a fair order that enables progress and secures our lives.

As we pursue our hopes, we must build upon the past and embrace the new.

Government has accomplished a great deal in the last third of a century, with more laws, spending, and programs than ever before.

We strive for full employment, improved housing, excellent education, thriving cities, and vibrant rural areas. We aim to protect the environment and enhance the quality of life. We must continue pressing forward urgently.

We must plan for a future where our wealth is redirected from destructive war to meet the urgent needs of our people.

The American dream is not achieved through complacency.

However, we have reached the limits of what government can do alone.

We need the collective efforts of the concerned and committed to match the magnitude of our tasks. We need grand efforts as well as small, local initiatives to build a cathedral of the spirit.

I do not propose a life of ease or sacrifice. I invite you to embark on a high adventure that is as rich as humanity itself and as exciting as our times.

True freedom lies in actively shaping our own destiny.

We can only be complete when we are part of a cause greater than ourselves.

Fulfillment comes from using our talents and achieving nobility through spirit and inspiration.

As we measure what can be done, we promise only what we can deliver. But as we set goals, we are lifted by our dreams.

No one can be fully free while their neighbor is not. Progress can only be made together.

This means unity between black and white, one nation, not two. The laws reflect our conscience, and now we must ensure that all are treated with equal dignity, both before God and man.

As we learn to unite at home, let us also strive to unite with the world.

Our goal is to welcome peace where it is absent, strengthen it where it is fragile, and make it lasting where it is temporary.

After a period of confrontation, we now enter an era of negotiation.

We invite all nations to communicate, share ideas, goods, and people. We aim for a world where no one lives in isolation.

While we may not make everyone our friend, we can avoid making enemies. We propose peaceful competition, not territorial conquest, to enrich humanity.

As we venture into space, let us explore new worlds together, not as conquerors, but as partners in a new adventure.

With those willing to join, we must cooperate to reduce the burden of arms, strengthen peace, and uplift the less fortunate.

To those tempted by weakness, we will make it clear that we will be as strong as necessary for as long as necessary.

In the past two decades, I have visited many nations and witnessed the divisions and fears that afflict the world.

I also know the people of the world. I have seen the suffering and grief that transcends ideology and race.

The heart of America is good. I speak from my heart and the heart of my country, conveying our deep concern for those who suffer and mourn.

I have taken an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and I pledge to dedicate my office, energy, and wisdom to the cause of peace.

Let this message be heard by the strong and the weak alike:

The peace we seek is not victory over others, but a healing peace that shows compassion and understanding. It offers all people the opportunity to choose their own destiny.

Recently, as the Apollo astronauts looked back at the earth from the moon, they reminded us of its beauty and invoked God's blessing upon it.

In that moment, poet Archibald MacLeish wrote:

""To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold--brothers who know now they are truly brothers.""

In that moment, their view from the moon reminded us that our destiny on earth is indivisible. Our fate lies not in the stars, but in our own hands and hearts.

We have endured a long night, but as we glimpse the first rays of dawn, let us embrace the remaining darkness and gather the light.

Our destiny offers us not despair but opportunity. Let us seize it with gladness and move forward, united in faith and purpose, aware of the dangers, but confident in our collective will as guided by God and the potential of humanity.",7.0,positive
"Dear Vice President, Speaker, Chief Justice, Senator Cook, Mrs. Eisenhower, and fellow citizens,

Four years ago, America was in a state of despair due to ongoing war and internal conflict. Today, we stand on the brink of a new era of peace. The question is, how will we use this peace? Let's make sure it's not a time of stagnation and isolation but a time of responsibility and renewal for America.

In the past year, our new peace policies have yielded significant results. By strengthening our existing friendships and engaging with countries like China and Russia, we have laid the foundation for better relationships among nations. Thanks to our initiatives, 1972 will be remembered as a year of immense progress towards lasting peace.

The peace we seek is not a temporary one but a lasting peace for future generations. It's crucial that we understand both the necessity and limitations of America's role in maintaining this peace.

If we don't work to preserve peace and freedom, we won't have either. However, our approach has changed in the past four years. We will honor our treaty commitments, vigorously support the principle of non-interference, and continue working towards nuclear disarmament and avoiding confrontations between major powers. We will defend peace and freedom, but we also expect others to do the same.

Gone are the days when America will involve itself in every nation's conflicts or dictate their futures. We respect each nation's right to determine its own path and secure its own future. Just as our role is essential in preserving global peace, each nation has a vital role in maintaining its own peace.

Together with the world, let's move forward. Let's tear down the walls of hostility and build bridges of understanding. Despite our differences in government systems, let's be friends.

Let's build a peaceful world where the weak are as secure as the strong, where each nation respects the right of others to choose different paths, where influence is based on ideas rather than force.

Accepting this responsibility is not a burden but rather the noblest endeavor for a nation. Acting greatly abroad will keep us great as a nation, allowing us to meet challenges at home.

Today, we have an unprecedented opportunity to improve life in America. We can ensure better education, health, housing, transportation, and a cleaner environment. We can restore respect for the law and make our communities more livable. Every American should have equal opportunity.

The magnitude of our needs demands bold determination to find new solutions. Just as we changed our policies for peace, we must change our failed policies for progress.

The time has come to distribute responsibility more effectively, both domestically and internationally. Relying solely on Washington's power has its limits. Let's move away from condescending paternalism. Individuals and nations must take on more responsibility and make their own decisions. Responsibility should be shared.

Today, I won't promise a solely governmental solution for every problem. We've been let down by unfulfilled government promises for too long. Government needs to take less from people so they can do more for themselves.

America was built by its people, not by government handouts. Let's shift our focus from welfare to work and from shirking responsibility to seeking responsibility.

In our own lives, let's ask ourselves what we can do for ourselves instead of relying on government. In facing challenges together, let's ask how we can help, not just how government can help.

The National Government has a crucial role to play, and it will act boldly and lead boldly where necessary. But each of us must also play a role, both as individuals and within our communities.

As we bring an end to our longest and toughest war, let's learn to debate our differences with civility and decency. Let's respect each other's rights and feelings, fostering an atmosphere of dignity.

Above all, let's renew our faith in ourselves and in America. Despite the challenges and criticisms we've faced, America has a remarkable record of responsibility, generosity, creativity, and progress.

We should be proud of our system that provides more freedom and abundance than any other in history. We fought not for selfish gain but to help others resist aggression.

Through our initiatives, we've made breakthroughs towards a lasting peace. We stand on the threshold of an era with challenges that surpass anything faced before.

We will be judged by God, history, and our conscience for how we tackle these challenges. As I stand here, I think about those who came before me and how they relied on help beyond themselves to realize their dreams for America.

I ask for your prayers, so that I may have God's guidance in making the right decisions for America. I also ask for your help to collectively rise to the challenge.

Let's make the next four years the best in America's history so that on our 200th birthday, America remains young, vital, and a beacon of hope for the world.

Let's move forward with hope, faith in each other, faith in God, and a constant drive to serve His purpose.",9.0,positive
"I thank my predecessor for their efforts in healing our land. We are here today to demonstrate the strength of our nation, both internally and spiritually. Our nation was founded on principles that we must uphold and adapt to changing times. I have taken the oath of office, guided by the timeless words of Micah. This inauguration marks a new beginning and a new dedication within our government. While the American dream still awaits fulfillment, we must have faith in it. Our society's definition of spirituality and liberty sets us apart, but also places a special obligation on us to fulfill our moral duties. I am grateful for the responsibility you have given me and seek unity and trust among us. Let us learn, laugh, work, and pray together, confident that we will triumph in the right. I believe we can make America even better and stronger. Let our recent mistakes renew our commitment to the principles of our nation. Our government must be both competent and compassionate. We have already achieved personal liberty, but now we strive for equality of opportunity and human rights. We recognize our limits and must have boldness as we face the future. Our strength abroad depends on our strength at home, and we must demonstrate that our democratic system is worthy of emulation. The world is experiencing a new spirit, with a rising passion for freedom. America's task is to help shape a just and peaceful world. We possess a quiet strength based on noble ideas, and we will fight poverty, ignorance, and injustice. Our idealism is not weakness, and we cannot be indifferent to freedom elsewhere. We seek a world where decency prevails and all people thrive. The world is caught in an arms race, but we are committed to limiting armaments and eliminating nuclear weapons. We have seen a renewed confidence within our people, and I hope that when my presidency ends, our nation will be remembered for humility, unity, productive work, a strong American family, respect for the law, and pride in our government. I hope that the nations of the world will see our lasting peace built on our values.

"We gather here today for a significant occasion - the transfer of power as outlined in the Constitution. We often overlook how remarkable this process is, but to the world, it is nothing short of a miracle.

I want to acknowledge President [name] for his cooperation in the transition, which has shown the world our unity and dedication to preserving individual liberty. The challenges we face include a severe and prolonged inflation that distorts our economic decisions and affects millions of lives. Our tax system also penalizes success and stifles productivity. Continuing down this path will lead to immense social, cultural, political, and economic upheaval.

We must act now to save our future. We cannot live beyond our means as a nation. Today, we must take steps to address the economic issues that have accumulated over decades. It will not be an easy or quick process, but we have the capacity and determination to protect our freedom.

In this crisis, we must recognize that government is not the solution, but rather the problem. We must work together, both inside and outside of government, to find equitable solutions that do not burden any particular group.

We are particularly concerned about a group that has long been ignored - the hardworking men and women who contribute to our society in various ways. They deserve equal opportunities, freedom from inflation, and a share in our revived economy. With our core values of idealism and fair play, we can create a prosperous America that is at peace with itself and the world.

We must remember that the government is meant to serve the people, not the other way around. It's time to reduce the size and influence of the Federal establishment and respect the powers granted to the States and the people. Our intention is not to eliminate government but to make it work for us, standing by our side and fostering productivity rather than stifling it.

We achieved greatness in the past by unleashing the energy and genius of the individual. However, unnecessary and excessive government intrusion has led to our present troubles. We must reject the notion of inevitable decline and instead embrace the spirit of America. We have the strength to overcome these challenges.

As we renew ourselves, we will regain strength and become an exemplar of freedom, offering hope to those who are currently without it. We value the relationships with our neighbors and allies and will maintain those connections. To potential adversaries, we reiterate our commitment to peace but also our readiness to defend ourselves if necessary.

We are a nation under God, and we believe in the freedom that God intended for us. It would be meaningful to declare Inaugural Day a day of prayer in the future. We stand here, surrounded by monuments to our history and heroes who fought for our freedom. Their sacrifices remind us of the price we have paid for liberty.

We have every reason to believe that we can solve the problems we face. We will remove obstacles holding back our economy, restore the balance between different levels of government, and reduce the burden of taxes. We will not compromise on these priorities.

In the words of Dr. Joseph Warren, we are a country that has the power to decide questions crucial to the happiness and liberty of future generations. We are ready to act, to do what must be done to ensure a better future for ourselves and our descendants. We believe in our capacity to overcome these challenges with God's help.

We must remember that the most formidable weapon we possess as free men and women is our will and moral courage. This is a weapon that our adversaries lack. We will not tolerate terrorism or aggression against our neighbors.

Today, tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held, and this fills me with gratitude. We are a nation founded on the principles of freedom, and I believe in the power of prayer. Let us work together, believe in ourselves, and have faith in our ability to overcome the problems that lie ahead.

We must remember what matters, beyond material possessions. We must leave a legacy of being loyal friends, loving parents, and citizens who improve our communities. We have work to do, from helping the homeless and the addicted, to fighting crime and providing education. We need engagement and involvement from every generation. We will work together, as a united Congress and Executive, to balance the budget and strengthen America's position in the world. Let us negotiate and produce results for the American people. We offer a new engagement to the world, staying strong to protect peace and working closely with the Soviet Union. Democracy and freedom belong to us all. We must be intolerant of drugs and work to stop their spread. There is hope for the future, despite our challenges, because our heart is bigger than our problems.

We must make change our friend, not our enemy. Though our challenges are great, so are our strengths as a hopeful and determined people. We must embrace this time and bring vision and will to our task.

Our democracy must be the engine of our renewal. Let us end the era of deadlock and drift and revitalize our politics. We must invest in our people and their future while cutting our debt. We must offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all. It is time to break the habit of expecting something for nothing. We must reform our politics and give power back to the people.

We must also meet challenges abroad. The world economy, environment, AIDS crisis, and arms race affect us all. America must continue to lead, shaping change with peaceful diplomacy when possible and force when necessary. Our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, embraced across the world.

The American people have called for change. We must now do the work that the season demands. I challenge the young generation to a season of service, to act on idealism and help those in need. We need each other, and we must care for one another.

Let us rededicate ourselves to the idea of America, an idea born in revolution and renewed through challenges. America's journey must always go upward.

The promise of America was born from the belief in equality and has been upheld throughout history, from ending slavery to advancements in civil rights. Now, as we enter the 21st century, we must choose to shape the forces of the information age, unleash the potential of our people, and strive for a more perfect union. Our government should be smaller but still stand up for our values and empower Americans to make a difference. We must take personal responsibility for ourselves, our neighbors, and our nation. Our diversity will be a strength, and as we progress, we can already see the potential of new technologies and global connections. We can achieve even greater successes, avoid unnecessary bloodshed, and overcome the divisive forces that threaten us. By embracing a new vision of government, a sense of responsibility, and a spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey. Education, safety, healthcare, and a strong defense will be our priorities. We will meet our obligations, balance our budget, protect our values, and preserve our natural resources. Our politics will be reformed, and the voice of the people will always be heard. Ultimately, our progress lies in the strength and decency of the human spirit. Let us honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and continue the quest for equality. We must rise above petty politics and divisions, for America demands and deserves big things. We must not waste this precious time, but instead, be strong, faithful, and courageous.

The expansion of freedom is the best hope for global peace. America seeks to support the growth of democratic movements and institutions to end tyranny worldwide.

Our survival depends on the success of liberty around the world. It is our duty to support democratic movements and institutions, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny. However, this is not a task that can be achieved through force alone. Freedom must be chosen and defended by citizens, protected by the rule of law.

Our nation's security and the calling of our time require us to promote freedom. We seek to help others find their own voice and make their own way, without imposing our own style of government. The objective of ending tyranny will take generations of concentrated work, but our influence is considerable and we will use it confidently.

My duty is to protect our nation from further attacks and emerging threats. We will stand firmly against those who deny freedom and oppress their people. We will encourage reform in other governments by making our expectations clear. Rights must be more than grudging concessions, they must be secured by free dissent and participation.

The power of our ideals should never be underestimated. Freedom eventually calls to every mind and soul. We will not ignore oppression or excuse oppressors. We stand with democratic reformers and believe that those who deny freedom to others do not deserve it themselves.

To serve their people, governments must trust them. We will walk alongside those who journey towards progress and justice. Division among free nations is a goal of freedom's enemies, and we must work together to defeat them.

At home, we have unfinished work to secure American freedom. We will extend the vision of economic independence and widen ownership of homes, businesses, retirement savings, and health insurance. By making every citizen an agent of their own destiny, we will achieve a more prosperous and just society.

Self-government relies on the governing of the self. Character is built in families, supported by communities, and sustained by the truths of different faiths. The exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy. We must value the life we see in one another and abandon all habits of racism.

The ultimate questions that judge us also unite us. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom, and did our character bring credit to that cause? These questions bind Americans of every party and background, as we strive to heal divisions and move forward together.

We have confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom, as it is the permanent hope of mankind. History may have its ebb and flow, but it has a visible direction set by liberty. Like the ringing of the Liberty Bell, our proclamation of liberty resonates in this young century. Renewed in our strength, we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.

May God bless the United States of America.",5.0,negative
"I stand here humbled by the task before us, grateful for your trust and mindful of our ancestors' sacrifices. I thank President Bush for his service. Our nation is in crisis, at war with violence and hatred. Our economy is weakened, and our healthcare and education systems are failing. The challenges we face are real and will take time to address, but we will meet them.

Today, we choose hope over fear and come together to end the divisiveness that has plagued our politics. We must set aside childish things and reaffirm our enduring spirit. We must work towards equality and the pursuit of happiness for all.

Our nation is prosperous and powerful, but we must not stand still. We must rebuild our foundation for growth by investing in infrastructure, science, and technology. We will harness renewable energy and transform our education system. We have achieved great things before, and we can do it again.

We reject the idea that our government is too big or too small. The question is whether it works for the people. We will hold ourselves accountable and restore trust between the government and the people.

The market is a force for good, but it needs regulation to prevent abuse. Our economy depends on extending opportunity to all, not just the prosperous. Our defense is not a choice between safety and ideals. We will protect our nation while upholding the rule of law and the rights of all.

We will work with other nations to address new threats and to promote peace and dignity. We will leave Iraq and work towards peace in Afghanistan. We will combat nuclear threats and the effects of climate change. America is a friend to all who seek peace.

We believe that our diversity is a strength. We will work towards a world where old hatreds dissolve and common humanity prevails. We seek a new way forward with the Muslim world and extend a hand to those who are willing to change.

We pledge to work with poor nations and to be responsible consumers of the world's resources. We honor our brave servicemen and women and recognize that it is the spirit of service that will see us through our challenges.

Our success depends on hard work, honesty, courage, fair play, tolerance, loyalty, and patriotism. We must return to these values and embrace our duties as citizens. This is the price and promise of citizenship.

Let us remember who we are and how far we have come. In the face of our hardships, let us have hope and virtue. Let us carry forth the gift of freedom to future generations. God bless the United States of America.",7.0,positive
"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.

We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.

We are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. 

Today's ceremony is special because we are not just transferring power from one administration to another, but from Washington, D.C. back to you, the American people.

For too long, a small group in our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Their victories have not been yours. But that all changes today.

This is your moment, your celebration, and your country. What truly matters is whether our government is controlled by the people.

We will prioritize the needs of American workers and families in every decision on trade, taxes, immigration, and foreign affairs. America will start winning again, like never before.

We will bring back jobs, secure our borders, rebuild our infrastructure, and strengthen our military. We will promote unity, solidarity, and patriotism.

We must think big and dream bigger. It is time to take action, and we will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.

We will unlock the mysteries of space, eradicate diseases, and harness the technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will heal our divisions.

No matter our backgrounds, we all share the same freedoms and salute the same American flag. Your voice, hopes, and dreams will define our destiny.

Together, we will make America strong, wealthy, proud, and safe again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.",6.0,positive
"Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.

This is America’s day. Democracy’s day. A day of history and hope. Of renewal and resolve. America has been tested and has risen to the challenge. We celebrate the triumph of democracy. The will of the people has been heard and heeded. Democracy is precious, but also fragile. At this hour, democracy has prevailed.

In the aftermath of recent violence, we come together as one nation to carry out the peaceful transfer of power. We look ahead with restlessness, boldness, and optimism to the nation we can and must be.

I thank my predecessors from both parties for their presence. We have learned from the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation. We acknowledge the lifetime of service from President Carter.

The American story depends on “We the People” seeking a more perfect Union. We are a great nation, made up of good people. We have come far over the centuries, but still have far to go. In this winter of peril and possibility, we will press forward urgently to repair, restore, heal, build, and gain.

This is a challenging time, with a once-in-a-century virus, lost lives, lost jobs, closed businesses, racial justice movements, cries for survival from the planet, political extremism, white supremacy, and domestic terrorism. We will overcome these challenges and secure the future of America through unity.

In 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and said his whole soul was in it. My whole soul is in bringing America together and uniting our nation. I call upon every American to join me in uniting against our common foes – anger, resentment, hatred, extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, and hopelessness. With unity, we can make important changes and right wrongs.

I know unity may seem like a fantasy, as the forces that divide us are deep and real. But throughout our history, our better angels have prevailed, carrying us forward through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks. Unity is the path forward – seeing each other as neighbors, treating each other with dignity and respect, and rejecting bitterness and chaos.

Disagreement must not lead to disunion. I will be a President for all Americans, fighting as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. Our common objects of love as Americans are opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and truth. It is our duty to defend the truth and defeat the lies.

There may be fear and trepidation about the future, but we must not turn inward or retreat into factions. We must open our souls, show tolerance and humility, and stand in each other’s shoes. If we do this, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, and more prepared for the future.

We will need each other in the work ahead, especially during this dark winter of the pandemic. It is a time for boldness, to face challenges of democracy, truth, the virus, inequity, racism, and the climate. We will be judged for how we resolve these crises. By rising to the occasion, we will write the next chapter in the American story.

I give my word to always level with you, defend the Constitution, defend our democracy, and defend America. I will serve with the public good in mind. Together, we will create an American story of hope, unity, light, decency, dignity, love, healing, greatness, and goodness. May this story guide us and inspire generations to come.

Our nation seeks the blessings of God and strives for righteousness, unity, and strength. We aim to speak truth, serve justice, and stay true to our honorable purposes in this time of trial. We live in a prosperous land, but we cannot ignore the struggles and dangers present in the world. International Communism poses a significant threat, seeking to enslave and exploit. However, we have witnessed the power of freedom-loving individuals, such as the heroes in Budapest, who yearn for liberty. Change and turmoil sweep across the globe, and we must face them head-on. Our goal is to build a peace rooted in justice and moral law. This peace requires the acknowledgement of all nations' equality, the support of the United Nations, and our active involvement in global affairs. We fully understand the interconnectedness of the world and the need to support the progress and well-being of all nations. We do not fear change; instead, we see the seeds of growth and progress everywhere. The American story has inspired millions around the world, and we are committed to fulfilling their aspirations for freedom and opportunity. We cherish our friendships with all nations, respect their independence, and offer help when needed. We also honor the people of Russia and welcome their progress in various areas.

"I transmit reports of heads of Departments to the Senate in response to their resolution. The military commandant in California continues to serve as civil governor until Congress establishes a government. I sent representatives to California and New Mexico to gather information. I encouraged the territories to form state constitutions and apply for admission to the Union, but did not authorize any interference. I do not have information on laws passed or census data. I recommended early statehood to avoid controversy. Each state has the right to establish its own laws, but the issue of slavery may cause unnecessary agitation. California plans to apply for statehood, but it was not influenced by me. Texas has a claim to part of New Mexico, and Congress must decide on a solution. The people of New Mexico are protected and have a military force. California can change its constitution after admission. The people should have the right to self-government. Congress does not need to establish a temporary government for the remaining territory. New Mexico may request statehood in the future.

"Tonight, I have the pleasure of announcing that we have reached an agreement to bring an end to the war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The official signing of the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam will take place on January 27, 1973. The cease-fire will begin on the same day at 2400 Greenwich Mean Time. We hope that this agreement will bring stable peace to Vietnam and contribute to lasting peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Throughout the negotiations, we have insisted on peace with honor, and all our goals have been met in this settlement:

- A cease-fire, internationally supervised, will start on January 27.
- Within 60 days, all American prisoners of war will be released, and a full accounting will be provided for those missing in action.
- In the same 60-day period, all American troops will be withdrawn from South Vietnam.
- The people of South Vietnam will have the right to determine their own future without outside interference.

This settlement has the full support of President Thieu and the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, as well as our other affected allies. The United States will continue to recognize the Government of the Republic of Vietnam as the sole legitimate government of South Vietnam. We will continue to assist South Vietnam as agreed upon and support their peaceful resolution of internal problems.

Ending the war is the first step towards building a lasting peace. All parties must adhere to the terms of the agreement and ensure its implementation. We will fulfill our obligations, and we expect all other parties to do the same. We also call upon other nations to help guarantee the success of the agreement and the maintenance of peace.

To the people of South Vietnam, we look forward to working with you in the future. To the leaders of North Vietnam, let us now aim for a peace of reconciliation. To other major powers involved, mutual restraint is necessary for the longevity of the achieved peace. And to the American people, your steadfast support made this peace possible.

We must be proud that we did not settle for a peace that would harm our allies or abandon our prisoners of war. We should honor the millions of Americans who served in Vietnam and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. To the families of our prisoners of war and missing in action, your long wait is coming to an end.

In memory of President Johnson, who dedicated himself to achieving lasting peace, let us commit ourselves to making this peace endure. Thank you and good evening.",8.0,positive

"In my previous message, I discussed the successful trade relations between the US and Canada and the need for further adjustments. Since then, negotiations between the two countries have continued, resulting in a reciprocal trade agreement. This agreement includes the elimination of disputes and the settlement of boundaries, navigation rights, and treaty interpretations. It also focuses on the economic benefits of closer trade relations and the exchange of resources between the two countries. This agreement is important for the future economic status and requirements of the US, as it allows access to Canada's natural resources and helps prevent a potential increase in the cost of living. The agreement expands the free list to include various food commodities, rough lumber, and raw materials. It also lowers duties on secondary food products and meat products. Additionally, it benefits industries such as agriculture and motor vehicles. This trade agreement is national in its scope and will benefit all sections of the US.

Education is our top priority. We have made progress with initiatives like opening doors to college, setting national standards, and connecting classrooms to the internet. Tomorrow, I will outline our plans for the future.

I will propose reducing class sizes in the early grades and providing funding for more classrooms. We will also support schools in ending social promotion and providing tools for student success.

Additionally, I will propose a national initiative for after-school programs to keep kids safe and teach them important skills. The Mott Foundation has pledged $55 million to support quality after-school programs.

"I'm providing a translation of the text for clarification:

""I am sending additional correspondence between the US and Chile governments. It includes a note from Mr. Montt, the Chilean minister at our capital, to Mr. Blaine, dated January 23. Mr. Blaine replied on January 27. There is also a dispatch from our minister in Santiago, Mr. Egan, transmitting Mr. Peteira's response to Mr. Blaine's note of January 21. Mr. Montt's note was delivered to the State Department on January 25 and I was notified later that day.
Mr. Pereira's response to our note of the 21st withdraws Mr. Matta's offensive note from last month and the request to recall Mr. Egan. It is a conciliatory and friendly response to the incident involving the assault on the sailors of the Baltimore. There is a good chance that the differences stemming from that incident can now be resolved without special powers from Congress. This is great news for me, Congress, and our people. The support shown for enforcing our nation's just rights in this matter has demonstrated the unity and patriotism of our citizens.
I will inform Congress if further communication is necessary.""",5.0,negative
"In my last annual message, I recommended currency legislation to protect our national finances, but Congress did not approve the plan. The situation has worsened, and I now ask for immediate action to restore confidence in our financial stability and prevent widespread distress. We must not let a false financial policy hinder our progress. The lack of confidence in our government's ability to pay its obligations in gold is the main issue. The only way to obtain gold is by issuing and selling bonds, but this method is unsustainable. We have already redeemed over $300 million in currency notes for gold, but they are still outstanding. We must reinforce our gold reserve, as its depletion will lead to misfortune and loss for our country. Increased revenue alone will not solve our problems. We need to recognize the importance of gold in our currency and finances. I propose issuing bonds with their principal and interest payable in gold, and I suggest denominations of $20 and $50 with a 3% interest rate. These bonds can be deposited by national banks to secure circulation, and banks should be allowed to issue circulation up to the face value of these bonds. Duties on imports should be paid in gold to maintain a reasonable supply in the Treasury. These provisions can be adjusted to any currency scheme endorsed by Congress. While I am reluctant to issue more bonds, I am determined to do whatever it takes to meet our national obligations with honor.",4.0,negative

They focus on opportunity rather than character. If the people want to limit immigration, it is their right, but I do not believe they have expressed that desire.

The crew displayed incredible courage and bravery, and we honor Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe as heroes. We cannot fully comprehend the impact on the families, but our thoughts are with them. The crew exemplified a hunger for exploration and service. Despite our familiarity with space, we must remember that we are still pioneers. To the schoolchildren watching, these hardships are part of the journey of discovery. The Challenger crew led us into the future, and we will continue their mission. This tragedy does not diminish our faith in the space program, and we will continue to explore openly.

"I am approving the act to regulate the counting of votes for President and Vice-President, as it provides a constitutional means to resolve the dispute over the election results. This is the first time a dispute of this nature has occurred, and it is crucial to determine the rightful Chief Magistrate through a lawful procedure. The President of the Senate has historically counted the votes, but disputes have always been resolved by Congress. However, this is the first time the outcome of the election is at stake, and the current circumstances are not ideal for reaching an agreement. Therefore, it is the duty of Congress to establish a fair and orderly method of executing the Constitution. The bill achieves this by allowing Congress to decide questions regarding single returns and creating a tribunal for double returns. It is important to have a definitive resolution to any disputes. With or without this law, one of the candidates has been elected, and it would be regrettable to have a contentious dispute about who should hold the office. It is essential for the preservation of our country and its free institutions that we adhere to constitutional law. While the bill only addresses the current election, it highlights the need for permanent legislation for similar situations in the future. Although the bill may not be perfect, it is suitable for the present circumstances. The country is in turmoil and seeks peace and harmony between all parties and regions. The economy is suffering due to the uncertainty surrounding the presidency. The country wants assurance that the election outcome will be accepted without resistance and that the Chief Magistrate's title is unquestionable.

"Fellow Americans, it has been almost three years since I last spoke to you. We have faced many challenges during this time, but I feel a special bond with all of you. Tonight, however, I am here for a different reason. I have made a difficult personal decision about whether or not I should run for re-election.

When I spoke to you before, our national defenses were weak, we faced humiliation in Iran, and there was a lack of trust in Washington. Additionally, we were on the verge of an economic collapse due to government overspending and excessive taxes. Inflation and interest rates were high, while wages and productivity were low.

But things have changed. Inflation and interest rates have dropped significantly, and the economy is improving. We have created millions of new jobs and are rebuilding our defenses to seek peace. We have also focused on restoring American values such as work, family, and freedom.

However, there is more work to be done. We need to create more jobs, control government spending, empower the states, maintain peace, and acknowledge the role of faith in our schools. We must continue to act worthy of ourselves and work towards the happiness and freedom of future generations.

I am grateful for your support and proud of what we have achieved together. Vice President Bush and I seek your continued support as we strive to complete what we started three years ago. Therefore, I am announcing that I will seek re-election.

The first creates the White House Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives, which will oversee our initiatives and ensure fair and supportive government partnerships. The second order will remove bureaucratic barriers and promote cooperation between government agencies and non-profit groups.

"Thank you for coming and joining me for an important announcement. I appreciate the presence of members of my Cabinet, Congress, and citizen groups. Immigrants have always played a vital role in our country, contributing to our economy and enriching our society. However, our current immigration system is not working, leading to an undocumented economy and insecurity for many workers. We need immigration laws that are fair, rational, and humane. I propose a temporary worker program that matches willing foreign workers with American employers. This program will provide legal status to undocumented workers, but it will have an end and participants must follow the rules. Employers have responsibilities as well, including making efforts to hire American workers first. We must control our borders and enhance security, while allowing for legal travel and trade. Our immigration laws should serve the economic needs of our country and not disadvantage those who come here lawfully. We should provide incentives for temporary workers to return to their home countries and contribute to their own retirement systems. Those who choose to pursue American citizenship should go through the normal process and not be given an automatic advantage over others. We must also set high expectations for new citizens, ensuring they understand what it means to be an American. This new temporary worker program will bring economic benefits and enhance security, while also protecting the rights of workers and providing them with legal documentation. By expanding economic opportunity in neighboring countries, we can reduce the pressures that lead to illegal immigration. The temporary worker program I propose is in line with our values and will restore order and fairness to our immigration system. May God bless you all.",6.5,positive

"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I am pleased to congratulate you on the positive outlook of our nation's affairs. The addition of North Carolina to the United States Constitution, the growing reputation of our country, the widespread support for our government, and the peace and prosperity we enjoy are all indicators of our national success. As we continue our discussions for the greater good, we can take pride in the fact that the measures taken in the last session were satisfactory to our constituents. However, we must continue to meet their expectations and secure the blessings within our reach through the exercise of patriotism, firmness, and wisdom during this session.

One important matter that requires attention is the defense of our nation. To preserve peace, it is crucial to be prepared for war. This necessitates not only an armed citizenry but also disciplined forces. We must have a well-planned and uniform approach to achieve this. Additionally, to ensure our independence for essential supplies, especially those related to the military, we should promote domestic manufacturing.

The establishment of our troops requires careful consideration, ensuring that the comfort and support of officers and soldiers are balanced with economic efficiency. While pacific measures were taken towards certain Native American tribes to protect the southern and western frontiers, it is evident from the information before us that we must be prepared to provide protection and punish aggressors if necessary.

In order to facilitate our relations with other nations, it is necessary to have provisions in place to fulfill my duties in a manner that serves the public good. Compensation for those employed in this regard should be defined by law, and a designated fund should be allocated for the expenses associated with our foreign affairs. It is also necessary to establish a uniform rule of naturalization to determine the terms upon which foreigners may become citizens.

Achieving uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States holds great importance and should receive our attention. Furthermore, we must promote and support the advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufacturing through both domestic and foreign innovation. Additionally, we should improve the Post Office and Post-Roads to facilitate communication and accessibility throughout our nation.

I am confident that we all agree on the significance of promoting science and literature. Knowledge is crucial for the happiness of our nation, and in a government like ours where the people's will directly influences decision-making, it is paramount. It empowers those in public administration by fostering their trust in the people and allows the people themselves to understand and appreciate their rights. It helps distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of authority, and it guides us in protecting our liberties while respecting the law.

The method by which we can best support education, whether through existing institutions or the establishment of a national university, should be a topic of deliberation in the legislature.",6.8,positive

I regret that I can't provide better news about the state of the Union. The hope for an amicable resolution has diminished, causing even more distress. We advertised Treasury notes, but no one offered to take them at a reasonable rate, showing that domestic strife is more damaging than a foreign war. As president, my duty is to enforce the laws, protect public property, and collect revenue. The hostile states have surpassed executive control, and it's up to Congress to address the situation. The Union is a valuable inheritance we must preserve. If it falls, both the North and South will suffer. We must give the people a chance to reflect and find a peaceful resolution. A compromise to divide territory and protect Southern institutions should be embraced. The seizure of federal property in several states is a serious and aggressive move, not a response to coercion. I have avoided actions that would increase tension or provoke war. I've sought a peaceful solution and refrained from sending reinforcements to Major Anderson. The desire was to avoid military conflict. I have provided copies of communication with South Carolina officials for your reference. Major Anderson's move to Fort Sumter was necessary for defense. We must take every opportunity to prevent hostilities.",4.5,negative
"I am pleased to report on the progress of the work on the Panama Canal. The sanitation work has been completed and the actual construction is underway. The commission and board of consulting engineers will soon present their recommendations for the canal's plan. All work has been done efficiently and with great care, giving us confidence that the canal will be finished sooner and within budget. I commend the government representatives for their integrity and effectiveness in carrying out this important project. 
Unfortunately, there have been false accusations made regarding misconduct and inefficiency on the isthmus. These accusations come from unreliable sources and individuals with personal grievances. Every accusation has been thoroughly investigated and found to be untrue. These false claims only serve to hinder the progress of the canal. 
Reducing salaries for the officials and workers involved in the canal's construction would be detrimental to the project. Skilled and capable individuals will not be attracted to the work if the pay is insufficient. The challenges of this project require highly competent individuals who are fairly compensated. The work on the canal is more difficult and comes with unique limitations associated with government employment. 
The progress on the canal has been excellent, with only minor mistakes. The Isthmian Commission and its subordinates have demonstrated remarkable dedication and efficiency. I welcome any investigation into their actions and promise appropriate punishment if any wrongdoing is found. However, it is crucial that they are paid properly and supported, as otherwise it will be difficult to find qualified individuals and delays and inefficiencies may occur.",6.0,positive
"Gentlemen of the Congress: The Central Empires have expressed their desire to discuss the objectives of the war and the possibility of a general peace. Talks have taken place at Brest-Litovsk between Russian and Central Powers representatives. The Russian representatives have made clear their principles for peace and offered a concrete program for implementation. The Central Powers, however, have proposed terms that would allow them to keep all territory they have occupied. The negotiations have broken off as the Russian representatives cannot entertain such proposals. The question arises as to whether the Central Powers speak for their majority parliaments or for the military and imperialistic minority. The Russian people, while currently powerless, continue to hold their principles and refuse to compromise. They call on us to state our desires and intentions. It is our hope to assist Russia in achieving liberty and peace. We propose open covenants of peace, freedom of navigation, removal of economic barriers, reduction of armaments, impartial adjustment of colonial claims, the return of occupied territories, and the establishment of a general association of nations. These objectives are not unique to us, but rather what the world needs to live in peace. We are ready to fight for these objectives, but only because we seek a just and stable peace. We have no animosity towards Germany and do not wish to impede her progress, but we insist on equality among nations. We hope Germany will join us in pursuing justice and fair dealings. We believe in the principle of justice for all peoples, regardless of strength or weakness, as the foundation of international justice. The people of the United States are ready to devote their lives and everything they have to the cause of liberty.

"Thank you all for coming. It's great to be here at Hamilton High School. We have big challenges in America, including ensuring that every child receives a first-class education and protecting our country from terrorism. We are committed to defending freedom and passing it on to the next generation. We owe the children of America a good education and today marks the beginning of a new era in public education. Our schools will have higher expectations and greater resources. Parents will have more information and say in their child's education. Students will have a better chance to learn, excel, and pursue their dreams. We thank the Secretary of Education and the members of Congress who have worked on this bill. Every child can learn and accountability is key. Schools that perform poorly will have time, incentives, and resources to improve, and parents will have options to choose a better school. Local communities know best how to achieve these standards and the federal government will trust them to do so. We will spend more money, but wisely, focusing on methods that work, especially reading. Our goal is to ensure that every child is reading at grade level by the third grade. We know what works and it's up to each local district to make it happen. This bill is the result of collaboration and it's just the beginning. We need the support of local citizens to demand high standards and ensure that no child is left behind. Thank you and may God bless.",6.0,positive

Iran has been a sponsor of terrorism and we will never let them have nuclear weapons. We eliminated Qasem Soleimani, who was responsible for atrocities and attacks on US personnel. We will impose economic sanctions until Iran changes its behavior. Iran's hostilities have increased since the nuclear deal. We must recognize the reality and work towards a safer deal. Peace cannot prevail while Iran continues to foment violence. We will ask NATO to be more involved in the Middle East. Our economy is stronger and we no longer need Middle East oil. Our military is strong, but we prefer peace. We destroyed ISIS and killed their leader. We should work together on shared priorities. We want a future of prosperity and peace for the people of Iran.

"This is a reassuring and hopeful moment as we gather here to sign a treaty that limits the spread of nuclear weapons. Over 55 nations are committing to this treaty, with more expected to follow. The purposes of the treaty are simple: to prevent nations without nuclear weapons from producing or acquiring them, to ensure that these nations can benefit from peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to push nuclear powers towards arms control and disarmament. This treaty is evidence that amidst tensions and struggles, nations have not lost their will for peace. It is the most important international agreement since the nuclear age began. It enhances global security by reducing the risk of nuclear war, encourages peaceful nuclear energy use, and maintains the impulse towards a safer world. The signing of this treaty builds upon previous successful agreements such as the Limited Test Ban Treaty and the creation of a nuclear-free zone in Latin America. We must continue this march towards peace and not allow it to be interrupted. The United States, as a nuclear weapons state, takes its responsibility seriously and pledges to only use its weapons in accordance with the UN Charter. We also commit to providing immediate assistance if a non-nuclear state is victimized by or threatened with nuclear aggression. We reaffirm our commitment to existing mutual security treaties and recognize that this treaty serves as an important security measure while also laying the foundation for expanded cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy application and further measures to halt the nuclear arms race. We are ready to cooperate fully in implementing treaty safeguards and will allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to apply these safeguards in the United States. We will also engage in exchanges of equipment, materials, and scientific information for peaceful nuclear uses and focus on the needs of developing nations. We will make nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes available to non-nuclear treaty partners without delay. Additionally, we are pleased to announce an agreement between the US and the Soviet Union to discuss the limitation and reduction of offensive strategic nuclear weapons and defense systems against ballistic missiles. We acknowledge that these discussions will be difficult, but we believe that the same spirit of negotiation seen in this treaty can lead to fruitful results. We have the opportunity to shape our destiny and live as brothers in the nuclear age.

"GENTLEMAN, I acknowledge and respect your constitutional right to express your opinion on the appointment of Samuel Bishop as the collector of New Haven. It is difficult to find the best candidate for executive duties, but I have obtained information that leaves no doubt of Bishop's fitness for the position. Despite his age, his competence and reputation have been proven through his previous offices. If he ensures that the office is well-managed, his appointment will serve the public interest. I understand your concerns but let's give him a fair chance. As for the removal of Mr. Goodrich, it was necessary to have a change in administration and appoint officials who align with the elected opinions. It is not right for one political sect to monopolize all offices. Vacancies can only be obtained through removal, and we aim to minimize the impact on good individuals while promoting justice and public utility. I regret that political differences have excluded people from self-governance, but I will strive to correct this and prioritize honesty, capability, and faithfulness to the Constitution in future appointments.

"Senator Lodge and Gentlemen of the Notification Committee:
I am deeply honored and grateful to receive the nomination for President by a party that has been successful in national elections for the majority of the past 40 years. The unanimous renomination expresses a continued confidence and regard that I greatly appreciate. The responsibilities of the office of President are immense, and I do not underestimate them. I am fully aware of the challenges that we face and the importance of finding solutions.
If the American people confirm the convention's decision in the November election, I will humbly accept the trust to serve as President and commit to working in the best interest of our country and the wellbeing of the new peoples under our care. I approve the declaration of principles adopted by the convention, and will formally accept the nomination in a later letter to your Chairman.
During the last four years, we have made significant progress. We have reaffirmed and strengthened the gold standard, improved the country's credit, funded the bonded debt, enacted a protective tariff, and achieved prosperity and success at home and abroad. However, our opponents still pose a threat to our financial stability with their desire for a different monetary system. We must unite to overcome these advocates of repudiation and ensure our public honor and honest money.
In addition to our domestic achievements, we have fulfilled our international duties. We have secured control of the Hawaiian Islands, reaffirmed the Monroe doctrine, ended the European alliance in Samoa, and obtained fair trade opportunities in Asia. We have also faced new challenges, particularly in relation to the Philippines. While we will provide amnesty and respect the rights of the Filipino people, our authority must remain supreme throughout the archipelago.
The recent crisis in China calls for careful consideration, and our primary focus should be the protection of American citizens and the peace and welfare of China. We must uphold our treaty rights and maintain impartial intercourse.
I want to commend the strong national sentiment and increased respect that the American name has garnered worldwide. We have made decisions guided by honor and duty, and I assure you that we will continue to fulfill our obligations without fear.
The Republican Party has a long history of dedication to freedom, and it has consistently championed liberty and emancipation. We have successfully freed millions from slavery and now have the opportunity to liberate millions more from imperialism. As we navigate through great problems and fulfill our responsibilities, I hope to gain the cooperation of members from all parties.
I am deeply appreciative of the honor and support conveyed through this nomination, and I extend my sincere thanks to the committee and the constituents they represent.",7.0,positive

I want to express my respect for the work that you do and the importance of alumni in supporting education. Education is crucial in the race against chaos, and I am fully aware of the responsibility that rests on my shoulders as President. Asia is a critical region, with a majority of the world's population residing there. The fight for independence and progress is happening all over Asia, and we have a significant stake in its outcome. We seek peace in Asia, not just the absence of armed conflict but also the resolution of hunger and hate. We are committed to fulfilling our obligations in Asia as a Pacific power. Our presence in Vietnam is not about conquest or gaining territory but about stopping the Communists and making their aggression unprofitable. We want to end the fighting and achieve an honorable peace. The nations of free Asia have made significant progress in building political and economic strength, and we have faith in their future. Reconciliation between nations that are enemies is also essential for lasting peace in Asia. A peaceful China is central to a peaceful Asia, and we continue to engage with China in the hope that they will open up to the world. We believe in cooperation and peaceful competition, and we are committed to helping build a world civilization in the Pacific. All Americans will do our part to achieve this goal.",7.0,positive

We acknowledge the walls that separated families and caused death, but we also rejoice in renewal. Berliners, you have overcome immense struggle, proving that freedom cannot be contained. In the future, an American President will visit a united Berlin, and a new American Embassy will stand here. Over the years, your courage has shined through in various ways - resisting tyranny, reuniting families, and fighting for freedom. Now, we must find the courage to build a new future. The Berlin Wall is gone, and we must decide what to build in its place - a Europe of independent nations, with free markets and prosperity. We must build bridges, not walls, and ensure that every citizen can reach their potential and raise their children in peace. The work of freedom is not easy, but we must reject division and believe in a peaceful coexistence with those who are different from us. There is reason to believe in the progress being made towards democracy and freedom, and America stands by your side.

"I urge all government officials to avoid using their positions to control local political movements. They should remember that they are meant to serve the people, not dominate them. Officeholders should not offend their neighbors with partisan actions, both politically and in their official duties. They should also refrain from dictating the political actions of their party associates or distorting the purpose of party organization. Federal officeholders should not manipulate political meetings or conventions, and should not actively lead political campaigns. While they have the right to engage in political affairs, their privileges and duties as officeholders should not lead to excessive activity.

We will win this election and prove the Republicans wrong. This convention met to express the will and beliefs of the Democratic Party, and now it's time for us to come together and defeat our common enemy. The Democratic Party has a record of accomplishments and has brought confidence and security to the people. We have increased farm income and wages, and the total national income has grown significantly. The Democratic Party has been successful in foreign policy and has promoted international cooperation. We have removed trade barriers and implemented foreign aid programs. We have built a strong Labor Department and worked towards labor-management harmony. The Republican Party, on the other hand, is controlled by special interests and has failed to address important issues such as high prices and housing. They have neglected education, social security, and minimum wage. They passed an anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic law and tried to sabotage power policies. I am calling Congress back into session to address these urgent matters. The American people will decide based on the record and actions, not empty words or platforms.

"Good afternoon. Congress has passed two bills on stem cell research that show the promise and perils of biotechnology. Our challenge is to use science to ease suffering without violating human life. I announced a policy in 2001 that allowed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, but only on already destroyed embryos. Over $90 million has been made available for research on these lines. One bill builds on this progress, which I signed into law. The other bill would support the destruction of human life for medical benefits, so I vetoed it. We must pursue the potential of stem cells ethically. Advances in research have shown the potential of stem cells derived without harming embryos. Funding has been expanded for research on stem cells from children, adults, and umbilical cords, which are already being used in medical treatments. Scientists are also exploring techniques to produce versatile stem cells without destroying human life. We must continue to explore alternatives and advance research while staying true to our morals. The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act prohibits the trafficking of human fetuses created solely for parts. I'm disappointed that Congress failed to pass a bill authorizing funding for ethical stem cell research. We cannot lose the opportunity to give hope to those with diseases. I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the National Institutes of Health to aid the search for ethical stem cell techniques. Unfortunately, a bill has been sent to me that fails the ethical test and would compel taxpayers to fund the destruction of embryos. I am vetoing it to prevent crossing a moral line and damaging science and ethics. We can advance science while upholding the right to life.

"Jay is prepared for questions and looks forward to the session. Over the next few weeks, there will be discussions on various issues, and a press conference will be organized to address these. The primary reason for speaking today is to address the Trayvon Martin ruling. Thoughts and prayers are sent to Trayvon Martin's family for handling the situation with grace and dignity. While legal analysts can discuss the case's legal aspects, it is important to understand the context and why the African American community feels pain and frustration. African American men often face discrimination based on past experiences. There is a history of racial disparities in the criminal justice system that impacts how people interpret the case. African American boys are statistically more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system, but this should not justify treating them differently. The African American community understands the challenges faced by African American boys but feels that context is often denied. African American boys should be given support and resources to help them succeed. It is important for society to examine state and local laws that may contribute to altercations and confrontations. Convening a conversation on race may not be productive, but individuals can engage in personal reflection and address any biases they may have.

"My fellow Americans,

Today, I sign into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This law is a proud triumph, shaped by the ideals of American patriots who fought for freedom 188 years ago.

Though we believe in equal treatment, many Americans are denied it. Our Constitution, principles of freedom, morality, and the law I sign tonight forbid this inequality.

The law was carefully debated and proposed by President Kennedy. It received the bipartisan support of Republicans and Democrats, as well as countless civic and religious leaders.

The purpose of the law is simple: it ensures that every American, regardless of race, has equal rights and opportunities. It does not restrict anyone's freedom or provide special treatment.

I am taking steps to implement this law: nominating LeRoy Collins as Director of the Community Relations Service, appointing an advisory committee, requesting supplemental appropriations, and directing government agencies to fulfill their responsibilities promptly.

We must approach the law with a spirit of compliance, not vengeance. Its purpose is to end divisions, promote freedom, pursue justice, and respect human dignity.

Voluntary compliance is the first approach, but national authority will step in if necessary. We all have a role to play in eliminating injustice in our country.

I urge every individual, from public officials to ordinary citizens, to join in this effort for justice and hope. Let us bring peace to our land by closing the springs of racial poison, praying for understanding hearts, and setting aside irrelevant differences.

In this time of testing, let us not fail. Let our unmeasured strength and unbounded spirit do the great works ordained for our nation.

"I am returning the joint resolution ""A resolution excluding from the electoral college the votes of States lately in rebellion which shall not have been reorganized"" to the Senate with my dissent. I believe that the assumption underlying this resolution, that some states are not entitled to representation in Congress and participation in the election of President and Vice-President, is incorrect. The acts of secession were null and void, and when the rebellion ended, the states resumed their relations to the Union by adopting the necessary measures for restoration. The resolution assumes that the states forfeited their rights and can only regain them through readmission into the Union as prescribed by Congress, but this contradicts the fact that the war was fought to suppress a rebellion within the Union. Additionally, the resolution assumes a power that is not delegated to Congress by the Constitution in regards to receiving and counting electoral votes. The Constitution only requires the President of the Senate to open and count the votes in the presence of both Houses. The resolution also implies that the state governments organized under military control are illegitimate, thus rendering the votes cast under the reconstruction acts invalid. I must point out that the declaration in the resolution, that no state whose inhabitants were in rebellion shall be entitled to representation in the electoral college, is flawed, as not all inhabitants in the Southern states participated in the rebellion. Lastly, I argue that if Congress can prevent states with rebel inhabitants from having their electoral votes counted, they can also do the same to Northern states, which also had inhabitants involved in the rebellion. This would allow Congress to control and determine the outcome of the Presidential election, depriving the people of their constitutional right to choose the President and Vice-President. Therefore, I believe the joint resolution is in conflict with the Constitution, and Congress does not have the power to impose conditions on the right to vote.",6.5,positive

We need all producers to join together in patriotic, honest production to prevent suffering and reversals. Understanding is crucial in industry.

We must not ignore the attempts to destroy our economic system and lead us down the path of tragedy, as seen in Russia. We should not limit freedoms like speech, press, and assembly, as repression does not promise a solution. These liberties are as sacred and inviolable as religious beliefs and the rights to life and happiness. While we have the right to crush sedition and threats to the Republic, we must remember that those who threaten the government or disregard lawful authority forfeit their right to freedom. 

Our popular government allows for orderly changes based on the majority's intelligence, but no majority should infringe upon the rights of the minority. People have the right to question our system, but they must also fulfill the obligations that come with freedom. We appeal to American intelligence and patriotism to address internal threats, just as we trusted it to protect our rights from external threats. 

We ask for stability from all Americans as we undergo necessary readjustments that impact everyone. Our party's platform reflects our concern for the welfare of wage earners.

The response to this proposal has been overwhelmingly positive, with 15 nations already ratifying the treaty and 31 others showing definitive adherence. The Treaty for the Renunciation of War represents a significant step towards world peace and deserves recognition. The President extends gratitude to the individuals who initiated and expanded this treaty, as well as the collaboration of the participating governments. The treaty has been proclaimed to the American people and will have a lasting influence on future international acts. The President, Herbert Hoover, has made this treaty public and expects all parties to fulfill their obligations in good faith.

"We have endured a week of violence and tragedy. I am appointing a special Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders to investigate the origins of these recent events and make recommendations to prevent future disasters. The looting and violence that occurred are crimes and must be dealt with forcefully. We must seek to end disorder through local police, state officials, and federal power if necessary. We will improve riot control training for the National Guard and work to protect our citizens from violence. However, peace cannot be achieved through force alone. We must address the underlying conditions that breed despair and violence: ignorance, discrimination, poverty, and lack of opportunity. We have already made significant efforts in this regard with various laws, but our work has just begun. Some may feel that we cannot afford to invest in the well-being of our cities, but we should count the assets that these measures can bring rather than counting bitterness. It is time for action, starting with legislative action, to improve life in our cities. We must not allow hatred and fear to divide us. Most Americans, regardless of race, lead decent lives and seek harmony with their neighbors. We condemn the violent few, but we must remember that law-abiding Negro families have suffered the most. We must not turn away from the goal of creating a decent and orderly society for all Americans. This will require dedication and understanding from every citizen. I call upon every American to search their own heart and reject violence. Violence only leads to destruction and suffering. Those who choose violence are heading for ruin and disaster. Public leaders have a duty to bring about peaceful change and cannot respond to these events with business as usual. Let us clear the streets and care for those who have suffered, but there should be no reward for those who caused that suffering. We can and will stop the violence. Let us build faith and trust between individuals and races. Let us work for better jobs, housing, and education for all Americans.

He acknowledges opposition from those who believe in unrestricted military strength, but believes that most Americans support the idea of reducing arms for world peace.

He points to historical examples of successful naval limitation treaties and warns against the dangers of excessive arms competition. The President compares the naval strengths of the United States, Great Britain, and Japan, highlighting the improvements that will result from the treaty. He emphasizes that defense is the primary function of government and asserts that the treaty provides adequate defense while promoting good relations. The President addresses criticisms of the treaty, particularly regarding the number and size of cruisers, and explains the advantages and savings provided by the treaty. He underscores the economic benefits of limiting naval construction and the potential for global prosperity.

"Governor Davey, Senator Bulkley, Chairman White, and People of the Northwest Territory,

Before 1788, white men scouted and explored this land, untroubled by Indians or redcoats. They held the wilderness with their own hands and rifles. However, Vincennes, not Marietta, symbolizes their success.

Marietta represents a new kind of settler, organized and committed to permanent security. They came to establish whole civilizations, guided by carefully planned colonization under the law.

The establishment of the first civil government west of the original thirteen states is what we celebrate today. The Northwest Ordinance, which I always like to remember, guaranteed freedom of religion, encouraged education, and abolished slavery.

The settlers who came to Ohio and beyond sought economic improvement and security. In log cabins, they found a certain but modest standard of living. They relied on each other and government as a tool of cooperation and self-help.

Today, as we face new challenges, we find inspiration in the pioneers' spirit of community and government cooperation. Just as they sought security in their cabins, we look to government for protection and support in areas such as banking, mortgages, and aging.

Government, at all levels, acts as an insurer of our collective security. It plays a role similar to the cavalry captain who protected the early settlers. The statutes we have today are a return to the mutual self-help practices of the past.

Let us not be afraid to help one another and remember that government belongs to us. The true rulers of our democracy are the voters. I believe that, like those who came before us, the American people want cooperative security and have the courage to achieve it. There will always be new frontiers and challenges, and we must face them together.

Unfortunately, our nation has been affected by anarchists, mobs, and criminals. Some state and local governments have failed to protect their residents. Innocent people have been beaten, businesses destroyed, and iconic landmarks vandalized. These are not peaceful protests, but acts of terror against humanity and God.

We need creation, cooperation, security, healing, and justice. That is our mission, and we will succeed. To restore security, I am mobilizing federal resources and urging governors to deploy the National Guard. If necessary, I will deploy the military. We are taking swift action to protect Washington, D.C., and implement a curfew.

Anyone threatening life and property will be arrested and prosecuted. The organizers of this violence will face severe penalties. We have one law, and once it is restored, we will help businesses and families.

The rule of law is the foundation of our prosperity and freedom. Without law, there is no opportunity, justice, or safety. We must reject anger and hatred because they undermine our freedom.

"Text: Good evening, my fellow citizens: The Alabama National Guardsmen were needed at the University of Alabama to enforce a court order allowing the admission of two qualified African American students. The students were admitted peacefully due to the positive behavior of the University of Alabama students. We should all examine our conscience and recognize that this nation was built on the principle of equality. American students of any race should be able to attend public institutions without the need for military backup. People of any color should be able to receive equal service in public places without resorting to protests. Every American should enjoy the privileges of being American, regardless of race. Unfortunately, this is not the reality. African American babies face greater challenges in education, employment, and earning potential compared to white babies. Discrimination exists in every city across the country and should not be ignored. We are facing a moral crisis and cannot solve this issue through police action or street demonstrations. Congress needs to pass legislation to ensure equal treatment for all Americans, specifically in public facilities and education. The federal government should also participate in lawsuits to end segregation in schools. However, legislation alone is not enough. This problem requires action in every American home and community. We must strive to create a better country where everyone has an equal chance to develop their talents.

"Thank you, Berlin. I come here today to speak of freedom. Berlin, with its history and courage, holds a special place in my heart. We gather here as a symbol of hope and triumph. The wall that divides this city represents a division that exists throughout Europe, and the world. It is a scar that we must face and overcome.



The Marshall Plan, implemented 40 years ago, helped rebuild cities like Berlin and create a prosperous and free world. The economic miracle in West Germany and Berlin is a testament to the power of liberty. However, there are still barriers to freedom, including the wall in Berlin. It is not just the German question that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.



The Soviets may be showing signs of change, but it is their actions that will truly indicate their commitment to peace and freedom. I call on General Secretary Gorbachev to come to this gate, open this gate, and tear down this wall.



While we must maintain a strong defense against Soviet aggression, we also strive for peace and arms reduction. The Western alliance has shown strength and unity in the face of new threats. We have the opportunity to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons and reduce the danger of conventional war.



In this age of progress and innovation, the Soviet Union faces a choice: change or become obsolete. We in the West are ready to cooperate with the East to break down barriers and create a safer, freer world. Berlin, as a meeting place of East and West, is the perfect starting point.



Together, let us strengthen the ties between the Federal Republic and the Western sectors of Berlin. Let us bring the Eastern and Western parts of the city closer together. Let us expand air access to Berlin and make this city a hub in central Europe. Let us host international meetings and promote cultural exchanges. And let us consider the possibility of holding the Olympic Games in Berlin.



Berlin thrives despite the challenges it faces. Something deeper than sentiment keeps its people here: love. Love for this city, love for freedom. The totalitarian world may suppress love and worship, but it cannot withstand them. The wall will fall because faith, truth, and freedom will prevail.

"In my annual message to Congress, I addressed the ongoing conflict in Cuba between the Cuban insurgents and the Spanish government. I expressed the sympathy of the United States for those fighting for liberty and self-government. However, I emphasized that the conflict has not met the conditions of war according to international law, and the insurgents have not established a viable political organization. The insurrection has not made progress and is limited to sporadic attacks. Both sides have engaged in brutal and inhumane actions, disregarding the rules of warfare. The United States has demanded reparation for the destruction of its citizens' property and the loss of lives. Despite efforts to resolve the conflict, no progress has been made. Many Cubans fleeing the island have sought to incite the US to intervene militarily. It is important to consider the principles of neutrality and non-involvement followed by previous administrations. The question of recognizing belligerent rights for the insurgents depends on the existence of a de facto government and military organization, which is currently lacking. Recognition of belligerency would have significant implications for US commerce and could lead to the interference with our revenue and the seizure of American vessels. It is essential to carefully consider the consequences before making any decisions. Spain has been unable to suppress the rebellion or provide justice for other nations' citizens. American citizens and ships have been targeted and their property seized or confiscated. The question of belligerency should be treated separately from these other issues, which have already been addressed with Spain through protests and demands for redress.",6.0,positive

Before the adjournment of this session, I want to highlight the importance of the following points from my previous message to Congress:

- President McKinley's words: President Palms of Cuba urgently appeals for legislative relief to prevent financial ruin.
- Unique proposition: Granting reciprocity with Cuba outweighs other nations and aligns with our protective system. Measures can be taken to ensure benefits go to Cuban producers.
- Focus on Cuba: The discussion should only be about achieving a friendly reciprocal arrangement with Cuba, not about revising other tariff schedules.
- Benefits for industries: The proposed action will not harm American industries and will benefit many. We should control the growing Cuban market.
- Increasing interest: Due to recent events and the future Isthmian Canal, we must focus on West Indies, Central America, and adjacent coasts. Cuba deserves exceptional economic treatment as they have complied with our requests.
- History with Cuba: We waged a war and have faithfully kept our promises. Let us continue supporting Cuba on their journey towards self-governing independence. They depend on us, and we owe it to them.
- Open-handed help: We have already helped Cuba, and we should continue providing assistance in a respectful manner. Cuba should have the chance to utilize their freedom with our support.

"Good evening. Our nation is facing numerous challenges, both at home and abroad. We are working to recover from a recession that has affected all Americans, while our military is fighting al Qaeda. I recently visited the Gulf Coast to address the oil spill crisis. On April 20th, an explosion occurred on the BP Deepwater Horizon rig, causing the loss of lives and the start of an oil leak. We assembled a team of experts led by Dr. Steven Chu to tackle this unprecedented challenge. Efforts have been made to capture the oil and a relief well will be drilled. This disaster is the worst environmental crisis in our history and will take months, even years, to address. We are committed to fighting this spill, making BP pay for the damage, and helping the Gulf Coast recover. I will outline our plan for cleanup, restoration, and prevention. We have already mobilized thousands of personnel, National Guard members, and equipment to contain and clean up the oil. We are implementing various methods, such as burning and skimming, to remove oil from the water. We are also constructing new barrier islands and working with affected states to protect their coastlines. We will continue to offer resources and assistance to the coastal states. While there have been challenges and damage, we are determined to restore the Gulf Coast. I will meet with the chairman of BP to establish a fund for compensating workers and business owners who have been harmed. We will also develop a long-term restoration plan for the Gulf Coast, with the cost being covered by BP. We are taking steps to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again. I have established a National Commission to investigate the causes and recommend safety standards. We have imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling and are reforming the Minerals Management Service to act as a watchdog. It is clear that we need better regulations and enforcement for offshore drilling. However, we must also recognize the risks of oil drilling and the need for a transition to clean energy. We have already taken action to promote the clean energy industry and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. This transition will require effort and resources, but the long-term costs of inaction are greater. We are open to other ideas, as long as they address our addiction to fossil fuels. Inaction is not an option. We have always been a nation that overcomes challenges and shapes our destiny. We must have faith in the future and work together as a nation. The Gulf Coast fishermen, despite facing the most difficult season, continue to gather for the ""Blessing of the Fleet"" tradition.

The bill fulfills promises made by the Republican Party to support legislation that gives the home market to American farmers and ensures the American labor in certain industries can compete and maintain their standard of living. The bill increases average duties collected on imports to around 16% compared to previous laws. It also increases the proportion of imports that will be duty-free. The increases in tariff mostly benefit the farmer, with 93.73% of increases on agricultural products. The bill has revised rates for about 27% of dutiable items. The flexible provisions in the bill allow for judicial review and adjustment of rates by a reorganized Tariff Commission, taking the responsibility off the President. The bill establishes a protective tariff based on the difference in production costs between home and abroad. If the flexible provisions are insufficient, further authority may be asked for the Commission. The bill addresses demands for protection for agriculture and labor, and also addresses complaints from foreign countries.

Approving this bill would suggest that the previous acts pertaining to the rebel states were constitutional, which I do not agree with. Additionally, this bill assumes that Arkansas is either not part of the Union or that Congress can arbitrarily exclude a state. However, if Arkansas is already a state, it does not need legislation to be represented in Congress. The Constitution already guarantees representation for each state. All that is needed is for each House to decide on the eligibility of those claiming seats in Congress. I recommend following the Constitution instead of passing legislation that is of doubtful constitutionality, unnecessary, and imposes more delays. The bill also asserts a power for Congress that is not found in the Constitution - the authority to impose conditions on a state's constitution and regulate the right to vote. This authority should be left to the states and the people. The bill also fails to specify how Arkansas would accept the conditions and what the consequences would be if the constitution is amended.

I believe in legislation to address labor relations abuses, and I made recommendations earlier this year for a commission to study and suggest laws. If Congress had accepted these recommendations, we would have better labor-management relations. However, the Taft-Hartley bill goes far beyond what people realize and restricts workers' rights. It weakens unions and undermines collective bargaining, taking power away from workers and giving more to management. This bill would even expose workers to labor injunctions and make unions liable for damage suits. It treats all unions the same, hurting those with good records as well. It does not prevent strikes in vital industries and would increase industrial strife. It would also lead to endless lawsuits between employers and unions. The bill threatens fundamental democratic freedoms by limiting political contributions and free speech. We have been making progress in labor-management relations, but this bill would undo that progress and divide the country. This bill is not in line with the labor legislation I recommended.

"Nearly 10 years ago, America experienced a devastating attack carried out by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network in Afghanistan. This marked a new type of threat to our security, targeting innocent civilians rather than soldiers. Following the attack, we united as a nation and took action against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. However, our focus shifted when we launched a second war in Iraq. Despite our efforts, al Qaeda's leaders escaped to Pakistan and continued plotting attacks, while the Taliban regrouped. To counter this, I made the difficult decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan and set clear objectives. Thanks to the efforts of our military, civilian personnel, and coalition partners, we have made progress and are now able to begin withdrawing troops. Starting next month, we will remove 10,000 troops by the end of the year and a total of 33,000 troops by next summer. Our mission will transition from combat to support, with Afghan security forces taking the lead. We have put al Qaeda under strain and killed Osama bin Laden, their leader. Despite remaining dangers, we will not stop until al Qaeda is defeated. In Afghanistan, we have inflicted losses on the Taliban and stabilized parts of the country. Afghan security forces have grown, and some responsibility for security has been transitioned to them. Challenges remain, but achieving our goal of no safe havens for al Qaeda is within reach. We must also address terrorist safe havens in Pakistan, working with their government to root out extremism. This past decade has been difficult, with many lives lost and wounds inflicted.

"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of Congress:

I feel compelled to address you again this session, despite the inconvenience and discomfort it may cause. We have a crucial duty to give our business community a banking and currency system that enables them to take full advantage of the freedom we are granting them. We must not leave them without the tools they need for their newfound independence.

We are about to remove the restraints of the protective tariff and set them free. It is our responsibility to understand and fulfill their needs. One of the most important needs is access to credit and financial resources. We must ensure that they have the means to energize their businesses and be successful.

It is not enough to simply remove restrictions on business. We must also provide constructive solutions. We must show that we understand their needs and can support and protect them. If we create new opportunities while maintaining other barriers, such as limited access to credit, our efforts will be in vain.

We know that the power of monopolies lies within the field of credit. We must act on this knowledge and make credit accessible to all capable and resourceful individuals. We must supply the banking and currency system that our country urgently needs.

The only question is when we will act. Should we act now, or wait until the demands become reproaches? The answer is clear. We must act immediately, even if it means personal sacrifice. The circumstances do not allow us to postpone this duty.

The principles we should follow are also clear. We need a flexible currency that responds to sound credit and the everyday transactions of individuals and businesses. Our banking laws should prevent the accumulation of monetary resources in a few hands and their speculative use. The control of the banking and issuing system must be public, not private, so that banks serve as instruments rather than masters.

Congressional committees have studied and proposed ways to achieve these objectives. They are ready to take action. I, as the head of the Government and leader of the ruling party, urge you to act now. Let us serve the country with careful deliberation and common counsel. I have confidence that you share this conviction. I am at your service to play any part in this reform, which will define our legacy.",7.0,positive
"Thank you for being here. I want to thank everyone involved in the victims' rights movement. The current criminal justice system protects the rights of the accused but often ignores the rights of victims. We need to change this by amending the Constitution and guaranteeing basic rights for victims. These rights include being informed about and attending court proceedings, making statements in court, participating in parole hearings, and receiving restitution and protection. Victims should have an equal say in the justice process. I have seen the unfairness towards victims, and it needs to be corrected. We need to level the playing field and ensure that victims' rights are given the same weight as the rights of the accused. I will work with Congress to create the best possible amendment that applies to all courts. This is not a partisan issue; it's about simple fairness. We need to protect victims and prevent criminals from taking advantage of these rights. While we work towards amending the Constitution, we must also enhance the protection of victims' rights now. I have directed the Attorney General to ensure maximum participation by victims and review existing legislation. We must make sure victims are not discriminated against in the workplace if they need to take time off for the justice process. Let's prioritize including victims and launch a system to keep them informed about case developments. Amending the Constitution is not something to be done lightly, but in this case, it is necessary to guarantee equal justice for victims. We must protect victims' rights and not let the government trample on them. Until these rights are enshrined in the Constitution, victims will continue to be denied equal justice.

"Senator Robinson, Members of the Democratic Convention, and my friends,

We gather here today at a crucial time for our nation's future. The decisions we make now will have a lasting impact on America.

I stand before you not just as a party leader or a candidate, but as someone burdened with great responsibility. I am grateful for the support and confidence of the American people and our loyal party members. I also thank those who have put aside partisanship to work towards our recovery.

We have faced adversity together and emerged stronger. We have conquered fear and made progress, but challenges still remain. Suspicion and intolerance lurk in our society. Modern civilization has brought new difficulties that must be overcome to preserve our political and economic freedom.

As we gather in Philadelphia, a city of historical significance, let us reaffirm our commitment to the principles of our founding fathers. Let us work towards restoring freedom and an American way of life in 1936, just as they did in 1776.

Freedom implies freedom from restraint. In the past, we fought against political autocracy and won the right to govern ourselves. However, new forces emerged with industrialization, and economic royalists gained power and control. They created a new type of despotism, using corporations and banks to further their interests while suppressing the average citizen.

We have witnessed the limitations of monopoly and a restricted market. Private enterprise has become privileged enterprise, and economic inequality has rendered political equality meaningless. It is the government's obligation to ensure equal opportunities in both the voting place and the marketplace.

The economic royalists may claim that we seek to overthrow American institutions, but in truth, we seek to dismantle their power and restore true democracy and freedom. The Flag and the Constitution symbolize democracy and freedom, not tyranny or mob rule.

This Convention has adopted a strong platform that emphasizes the government's obligations to its citizens, including protection of the family, establishing a democracy of opportunity, and providing aid to those affected by disaster. However, our enemies within will continue to challenge these ideas, and it is our duty to stand up for them.

The defeats and victories of the past few years have taught us valuable lessons about our government and ourselves. We have realized the importance of moral principles in guiding a nation. We rely on faith, hope, and charity to fight for freedom in a modern civilization.

We cannot ignore the plight of the unemployed or allow a deficit in human fortitude. Instead of privileging a few, we must build a society based on faith, hope, and charity for all.

Being a servant of this cause is humbling. It is the American people who carry the standard of this cause, and we must learn from our mistakes and continuously strive to do better.

Governments can make mistakes, but it is better to have a government that acts with charity than one that remains indifferent. Our generation has a great responsibility and a rendezvous with destiny. We must not become weary like others and surrender our democracy. Our success will reignite hope around the world and save democracy for ourselves and generations to come.

I accept the commission you have given me and join you in this war for democracy. I am committed to this cause until the end.

Thank you.",6.5,positive
"It has been several months since we last discussed government problems. Since January, we have been working to fulfill previously discussed plans and policies. The achievements of this session of Congress show that its task was to complete and strengthen the work started in 1933. This Congress displayed less partisanship than any other peace-time Congress. Major enactments included debt readjustment, industry assistance, securities regulation, foreign trade agreements, and strengthening of various sectors such as agriculture, labor, and law enforcement. The Congress also created a national housing program and a permanent federal body for communication regulation. Our monetary system was reorganized and our focus shifted towards relief, recovery, reform, and reconstruction. We have made substantial gains in wages, employment, farm products, bank deposits, and home and farm preservation. Recovery can be evaluated by individual circumstances, and our rights and liberties have not been compromised. Those who doubt the gains are seeking special privileges. The Administration seeks the best talent for public service and is devoted to serving the public. Our program is evolving, focusing on fair relationships between employees and employers, protection against unfair practices, and prevention of skyrocketing prices. Our future program aims to provide better housing, better use of land and water resources, and social insurance. Critics may label our program as fascism, communism, regimentation, or socialism, but it is a practical fulfillment of tested American ideals. Our new structures are modernized, yet blend with the old. We are restoring confidence and well-being under the rule of the people. I am looking forward to my upcoming trip to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Canal Zone, Hawaii, and to meeting the Presidents of Haiti, Colombia, and Panama. Taking a break is important for a change of scenery. I plan to inspect national projects, visit national parks, and learn about actual conditions across the country.

"I am honored to be here at the 38th Annual Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Recent events have shown us the importance of ensuring that all Americans have the rights and freedoms that they deserve. We must continue to protect and extend civil rights for all Americans. We believe in the freedom for every individual to live their life as they choose, limited only by their responsibility to others. We must remove the barriers that prevent citizens from enjoying their rights and equal opportunities. Discrimination based on ancestry, religion, race, or color is unjustifiable. Every person should have the right to a decent home, education, medical care, a job, the ability to vote, and a fair trial. Sadly, prejudice and intolerance still exist, and we must work to eliminate them. The support of other countries in our fight for democracy depends on us showing that we can uphold our own principles. We can no longer wait to address prejudice and discrimination, and our national government must lead the way. We have appointed an Advisory Committee on Civil Rights to develop a program for action. We must strive to advance civil rights wherever we can, such as extending basic civil rights to Guam and American Samoa. This is evidence of our belief in the ability of all people to build free institutions. It will not be easy, but we must guarantee the civil rights of all our citizens. We have a long history of charters and declarations that guide us, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Emancipation Proclamation. We are also working towards an International Bill of Rights. With these principles and our faith, we can create a happier and more secure nation for everyone.",8.5,positive

"Citizens, today we gather to address the devastating situation in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The media has already depicted the horrors of the calamity, but here in the national capital and across the country, we have the power to provide relief through love and charity. Let us express our sympathy and brotherhood for our fellow Americans in need.

I am pleased to announce that Jacksonville, Florida, a city recently struck by adversity, has offered $2,000 in aid for the people of Johnstown. However, there is no time for words. We must act swiftly to alleviate their suffering.

The governor of Pennsylvania has informed me that there is an urgent need for food in Williamsport, another affected area. I propose creating a committee to gather food donations, which can be sent directly to Williamsport by train.

Additionally, many individuals have lost their homes and belongings. Therefore, another committee should collect clothing and especially bedding items, such as blankets, to provide temporary comfort.

Furthermore, a committee of business representatives should be formed to collect money for long-term reconstruction efforts and to aid those who have lost everything.

In conclusion, as a temporary citizen of Washington, I would be proud if our city could respond generously to this call for help and stand out among the rest of the nation.

Lastly, as I call for donations, I must mention that I have personally contributed to the cause. It is important for me, as someone urging others to give, to disclose this information.",7.0,positive

"Dr. Nabrit, my fellow Americans: 

I am delighted to speak at this historic institution. Howard is an outstanding center for the education of Negro Americans, representing democratic excellence. Our earth is revolutionary, with hope for justice in every corner of the world. The revolution of the Negro American is particularly significant for our destiny.

American Negroes have been deprived of freedom and opportunity for too long. Change has come to this nation, with peaceful protests and legislation leading to progress. We have witnessed victories for civil rights, but there is still work to be done.

Equality is not just about freedom, but also about providing equal opportunities for all citizens. We must give 20 million Negroes the chance to learn, work, and pursue their happiness. Ability depends on factors such as family, neighborhood, and education, and these must be addressed.

While there have been achievements for the Negro Americans, the majority still face poverty, unemployment, and discrimination. The barriers to equality are not just economic, but also rooted in a history of slavery and injustice. The breakdown of the Negro family structure contributes to the challenges they face.

Jobs, decent homes, education, welfare programs, healthcare, and compassion are all part of the solution. However, we must continue to search for answers and understand the complexities of these issues. I will convene a White House conference to bring together experts and leaders to work towards fulfilling the rights of the American Negro.

Justice in America means fulfilling the fair expectations of all individuals, regardless of race. It is our duty to end the wrongs endured by the Negro community and discover America for ourselves. This will require a collective understanding of our country's values and potential.

Together, we can light a candle of understanding in the hearts of all Americans, ensuring that progress never fades.",5.0,negative
"On June 4, 1944, Rome fell to American and Allied troops, marking the first Axis capital to be captured.

Italy, previously under Mussolini's rule, has joined in the fight against Germany. The capture of Rome is strategically important, but the road to victory is still long and challenging. The Italian people have suffered under Fascist misrule and now need assistance in rebuilding. Italy has a rich cultural heritage and should contribute to global progress. The Germans left Rome on the brink of starvation, and efforts are underway to provide relief.

The government should strive to maintain good faith with China and ensure justice for these incidents. Efforts have been made to prevent violence and assist China in investigating.

"Mrs. Kennedy and I, along with Vice President and Mrs. Johnson, and Members of Congress, welcome the Ambassadorial Corps of our Hemisphere to the White House. 139 years ago, the United States supported the independence and recognition of the new Latin American Republics. Bolivar envisioned the Americas as the greatest region, not just by wealth, but also by freedom and glory.

Our hemisphere's dream of fulfillment is closer than ever, but also facing great risks. We have the tools to lift our people from poverty and ignorance, and allow them to fulfill their spiritual and intellectual potential.

However, we face the same forces that have threatened America throughout history - the alien forces that seek to impose Old World despotism on the New World.

Today, I want to discuss these challenges and dangers with you, as ancient friends united by our determination to advance the values of American civilization. Our continents share a common history and struggle for independence, as well as a quest for human dignity and freedom.

We must demonstrate to the world that economic progress and social justice thrive through free men and democratic institutions. Our unfulfilled task is to achieve this in our hemisphere.

To address the urgent problem of poverty and hunger in Latin America, I propose the creation of a new Alliance for Progress - a vast cooperative effort to provide homes, work, land, health, and schools to the American people.

We must start a Ten Year Plan for the Americas, transforming the 1960s into a decade of democratic progress. The success of this plan depends on the efforts of the American nations themselves, with outside assistance providing impetus to progress.

To support this effort, we need to convene a ministerial meeting to plan and allocate resources. We have requested $500 million from Congress as a first step in fulfilling the Act of Bogota, designed to combat illiteracy, improve productivity and land use, eliminate disease, and offer educational opportunities.

Additionally, we must support economic integration, resolve commodity market problems, expand food assistance programs, promote scientific cooperation, and enhance training and education programs.

We also reaffirm our pledge to defend any American nation in danger, as we aim to allocate more resources to constructive use instead of warfare.

Lastly, we invite our Latin American friends to contribute to the enrichment of life and culture in the United States, fostering understanding and mutual respect among the nations of the hemisphere.

Our goal is to build a hemisphere where all can hope for a suitable standard of living, and live in dignity and freedom. Political freedom must accompany material progress, and social change must be freely made to ensure the prosperity and freedom of all.

This task requires the efforts of all governments and the support of the people.

"To the House of Representatives: I return without approval House bill No. 7864, which seeks to amend the immigration laws of the United States. This bill proposes a radical departure from our current national policy on immigration. While it claims to address concerns about the quality of recent immigration, it fails to provide clear evidence or a justifiable alternative. 
The bill suggests implementing an educational test to determine the right of a foreigner to enter the country. However, I believe it is more prudent to admit immigrants who seek a home and work opportunities, even if they are unable to read and write. It is crucial to consider that illiterate immigrants are not the ones causing violence and disorder, but rather the victims of educated agitators. The ability to read and write does not necessarily indicate contented industry or desirable citizenship. If there are specific concerns about certain immigrant groups, they should be dealt with directly instead of using illiteracy as an excuse for exclusion. 
Moreover, the provisions in the bill to prevent hardship are unclear and inadequate. Only certain relatives of qualified immigrants are allowed to accompany or be sent for, leaving out others like brothers and sisters. The requirement that the immigrant must be capable of supporting their illiterate relatives upon arrival presents a flawed assumption that all illiterate immigrants are likely to become public charges. 
The bill also criminalizes the employment of aliens on public works of the United States and coming into the country regularly for work purposes. These provisions, particularly in relation to the northern border and neighboring countries, are illiberal and narrow-minded. They risk damaging relationships with our neighbors and may provoke retaliatory measures against our own citizens. 
Furthermore, the language used in these provisions is vague and subject to different interpretations, making it challenging to enforce and leading to potential harm to our citizens. 
For these reasons, along with others not specified, I find this bill unnecessary, harsh, and oppressive, with potential negative consequences for our citizens.",6.7,positive

"I have examined the bill entitled ""An act supplementary to an act entitled 'An act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States,' passed March 2, 1867, and to facilitate restoration"" and I am returning it to the House of Representatives with my objections. This bill pertains to elections in the ten States affected by the original act. The details focus on the formation of State constitutions, but also impact all elections while the original act is in effect. The bill requires registration of voters and an oath stating that they have not been disfranchised for participation in rebellion. The bill also appoints boards of registration with unlimited discretion and no appeal process. By excluding a significant portion of the population from voting, this bill does not represent the wishes of the people. It forces the formation of new constitutions based on universal Negro suffrage, disregarding existing constitutions. This legislation enforces martial law, military coercion, and political disfranchisement for its own purpose. As a result, the people in the South are left with the choice of imposing complete Negro enfranchisement and white disfranchisement or continuing to live under martial law. It is deplorable to see our fellow citizens subjected to this without any freedom or constitutional rights. After the war, I believed in reconciliation and restoring political rights to the people, but Congress did not support this. Instead, the South is now under absolute military despotism and deprived of their guaranteed rights. The imposition of military rule and forced elections goes against the principles of republican government. I believe that eventually, these States will regain their rightful place in the Union and oppressive legislation will be erased.

I am honored to be here today on the 94th anniversary of the Charter.

From its early beginnings, this university recognized the importance of education in maintaining a free society. Not only does it contribute to the economic self-interest of graduates, but it also shapes responsible citizens.

It is encouraging to see that this tradition continues. Graduates from this university have gone on to hold important positions in government and institutions. Furthermore, the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to seek joint exploration of space may have profound implications for the future. Not only can it advance space science, but it can also foster peace and unity between nations.

This university, with its distinguished faculty and commitment to freedom of inquiry, plays a pivotal role in the pursuit of knowledge. We must recognize the interdependence of all knowledge and the benefits of collaboration. This is especially crucial in our efforts to achieve peace. As new nations gain independence, their aspirations for self-determination and cooperation align with our American principles.

While the path ahead may be uncertain and challenging, we can be confident in the direction history is moving. We must use our knowledge to meet unprecedented problems with intelligent solutions. We should reject oversimplified theories of international relations and embrace a more flexible world order.

As we work towards this vision, the role of universities becomes increasingly vital. They serve as a source of ideas and provide a long-term perspective. We must act not just for the present, but for the future. Let us not delay in taking action towards a world of knowledge, cooperation, and lasting peace.",6.5,positive
"I am pleased to address the Foreign Service Institute and meet Americans preparing to serve abroad. We must continue our global reach, and I am encouraged by your dedication. Your job is to promote peace. The question is, how? We must start with the world in 1945, when Europe was devastated. Now we have a new Europe, confident and progressive, thanks to collective action and NATO. We believe in adapting NATO to the changing times, with consultation among member nations. NATO is not about making war, but about keeping peace. It has successfully deterred war through integrated military power and unity of purpose. We must continue collective action to prevent war. The United States is committed to preserving and strengthening NATO. We hope all members will join in the common task. Our strength offers hope for reconciliation and a brighter future, not just in terms of wealth, but in unity and the progressive application of human solidarity. Our efforts should be directed towards preserving human solidarity. Thank you.",7.0,positive
"Due to ample reflection and careful deliberation, I must protest against the accusatory clauses of the House of Representatives' resolution. These clauses call for investigation into whether the President or any government official has used money or influence to impact Congress's actions or hinder the execution of laws. I acknowledge that inquiries into post offices, navy yards, and public works are appropriate and within the House's legislative responsibilities. However, I emphasize the distinction between accusatory and remedial clauses in the resolution. The House does not possess power over the President in any aspect except impeachment, as stated in the Constitution. The President's responsibility lies with the people of the sovereign states, not the House. The President's role extends beyond executive duties and includes legislative discretion, requiring his approval for any bill to become a law. Coordination and mutual respect between government branches should guide their conduct. The accusation against the President lacks specificity and pertains to the entire legislative process, making it overly vague. The accused offense is not limited to any particular law or action, undermining the fairness of the investigation. In previous cases, such broad accusations would not have warranted inquiry. This proceeding is reminiscent of the star-chamber and general warrants, constituting a violation of universal justice. The House, as the impeachment power, should have followed established precedents and assigned the accusation to the Judiciary Committee. By making the accuser the judge, the House denies the President due process. The investigation proposed by the resolution lacks clarity and encompasses the entire legislative sphere, making it unreasonable and unfounded. The President's rights, protected for every citizen facing criminal charges, are ignored. This entire proceeding supports fears that the legislative branch seeks to overpower the executive and judicial branches. I protest these actions on behalf of the people, as they violate the independence and rights of the executive branch, establish a culture of informant reliance, harm the harmonious functioning of government, and set a dangerous precedent for future Presidents, regardless of their political affiliation.",5.0,negative
"I cannot sign the bill ""An act to set apart and pledge certain funds for internal improvements,"" as it goes against the Constitution. The power to construct roads and canals and improve water navigation is not within Congress' enumerated powers. Referring to the clause ""to provide for the common defense and general welfare"" would undermine the specific powers listed in the Constitution. This would also give Congress general legislative power instead of the limited power intended. It would override state laws and exclude the judicial authority of the United States. Restricting the power to cases that require expenditure of money still allows for important measures. Consent from the states cannot extend Congress' power beyond what is specified in the Constitution. Despite the importance of infrastructure, a power not explicitly granted by the Constitution cannot be assumed. The success of the Constitution relies on a clear division of powers between the federal and state governments. The beneficial goals of the bill can be achieved through other means, following the wisdom and virtue of the nation that established the Constitution. JAMES MADISON.",6.5,positive
"To the House of Representatives:
I am returning the bill ""An act to facilitate the refunding of the national debt"" with my objections. I believe that a measure to refund the national debt is necessary, but this bill contains provisions that would harm the national banking system. Section 5 of the bill restricts the use of bonds as security for bank circulation, which would prevent the organization of new banks and hinder the expansion of existing ones. This change would jeopardize the entire banking system and hinder the country's growing prosperity. Therefore, I cannot support this bill and recommend further consideration.

"Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, I have carefully considered your request to provide copies of documents related to the Treaty with Great Britain. While I have always been committed to transparency and cooperation with Congress, I must consider the potential consequences of granting this request. Foreign negotiations require caution and secrecy, and full disclosure could hinder future negotiations and even lead to harm. The power to make treaties is vested in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and this has been the understanding of foreign nations. The House of Representatives has previously acquiesced to this interpretation, and there is reason to believe that it aligns with the opinions of the State Conventions. Therefore, I cannot comply with your request as it goes against the boundaries set by the Constitution and the duties of my office.",7.0,positive
"To the Senate and House of Representatives:

I believe it is important to inform Congress of the proclamation made by the Secretary of State regarding the ratification of the fifteenth amendment. This amendment grants voting rights to 4 million people who were previously deemed non-citizens and ineligible for such rights. This is a significant milestone in the history of our free government.

As a nation that derives its power from its people, we must rely on their intelligence, patriotism, and hard work. I urge the newly enfranchised citizens to make every effort to prove themselves worthy of this privilege. To those who were already privileged under our laws, I implore you to not withhold any opportunities for advancement from these new citizens. The framers of our Constitution believed that a republican government cannot thrive without widespread education and intelligence among the people.

I want to emphasize that the adoption of the fifteenth amendment is the most important event since our nation's founding. Its success will depend on heeding the urgent recommendations of George Washington and promoting education throughout the country. Only through knowledge can the benefits of this amendment be fully realized.

HAMILTON FISH, SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.
   
Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State of the United States, hereby certifies that the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States has been ratified by 29 out of 37 states, making it valid as part of the Constitution. I attest to this on March 30, 1870.

Hamilton and Washington knew the importance of security, but they couldn't have anticipated our current situation. Recently, we have realized the danger of involving ourselves in European conflicts. As a senator, I heard appeals from Americans with connections abroad, which made me understand their concern for their native lands. However, this is dividing our citizenship and preventing assimilation. We need to focus on our own peace and unity, rather than trying to solve world problems. We want a free America at home and in the world, with harmony among all. I value domestic peace over international peace.",6.5,positive
"Fellow-Citizens:

I am once again asked to serve as the President of the United States. When the time comes, I will express my gratitude for this honor and the trust placed in me by the American people.

Before I can begin any official duties, I must take an Oath of Office as required by the Constitution. I am about to take this oath in front of you. If I violate it during my term, I may face punishment and criticism from all of you who are witnessing this important ceremony.",6.0,positive
"When America first realized that it had no choice but to either submit to foreign rule or fight for independence, there were concerns about the potential conflicts and disagreements that would arise when deciding on a government for the entire country. However, despite these uncertainties, the representatives of the nation broke free from the chains of oppression and launched into an uncertain future.

During the Revolutionary War, the people's passion and determination maintained some level of order, but it was clear that a more structured system was needed. The Confederation, based on examples from other countries, was created but it was evident that it would not last due to negligence, disobedience, and decline.

In this crisis, the American people showed their wisdom and resolve in taking measures to form a stronger union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for defense, promote welfare, and secure liberty. Through public discussions and deliberations, the present Constitution of Government was created.

Having been abroad during these events, I first encountered the Constitution while overseas. Without any bias or influence, I found it to be a result of intelligent and moral individuals creating a government that suited our nation. As a citizen with a right to vote on the adoption of this constitution, I openly expressed my approval. The fact that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent did not concern me, nor did I consider any changes to the Constitution unless deemed necessary or expedient by the people themselves.

After returning to my country, I had the honor of being elected to a position under this new government, and I have consistently supported the Constitution. It has met expectations and brought peace, order, prosperity, and happiness to the nation. I have developed an attachment and respect for it.

What other form of government could deserve our admiration and love? Our government, where citizens are chosen to make and execute laws, representing the power and majesty of the people, is a spectacle of beauty and greatness. Robes and diamonds add nothing significant; true authority comes from the hearts and judgments of the people. The existence of our government proves that knowledge and virtue are widespread among the people, which is a pleasing thought.

We must always remember the danger to our liberties if our elections are corrupted or influenced by external forces. The government should be the choice of the American people, not a result of foreign interference. The purity of our elections is vital.

Under the administration of a citizen who led with wisdom, justice, temperance, and fortitude, our nation has experienced peace, prosperity, and increasing wealth. We owe gratitude to this citizen and his name will serve as a bulwark against any who seek to harm our country's peace. His successors have been advised to follow his example.

While I should remain silent on this topic, I believe it is appropriate to say that my principles align with a free republican government and a commitment to support the Constitution unless the people decide otherwise. I respect the state governments and value the rights and interest of all states equally. I believe in justice, humanity, and equal laws. I have an appreciation for the Native American nations and hope to improve their conditions. I am committed to maintaining peace and neutrality with other nations. I have a personal fondness for the French nation and wish to preserve our friendship. I am dedicated to doing what is right for the American people, seeking justice and maintaining peace with all nations. I have confidence in the American people, their resources, and their spirit. I believe in the high destinies of this country and my duties towards it. Lastly, I have a deep respect for Christianity and believe it is important in public service.

With the support of the American people, I am confident that the Constitution will endure and succeed. I am committed to upholding it to the best of my ability.

"Friends and citizens, I am grateful for your support and aware of the immense responsibility of this office. Our nation is flourishing, engaging in trade with powerful nations, and heading towards great destinies. I am humbled by the magnitude of this task. However, I find comfort in the wisdom and virtue of our Constitution and its provisions for other authorities. I look to the legislative branch for guidance and support as we navigate the challenges of a troubled world. Let us remember that while the majority rules, the minority's rights must be protected to avoid oppression. We must unite and restore harmony in our society, free from religious and political intolerance. While differences of opinion exist, they do not undermine our shared principles as Republicans and Federalists. As for those who doubt the strength of a republican government, let us trust in its resilience and the unwavering commitment of its citizens. In addition to our many blessings, we need a wise and frugal government that promotes justice and leaves individuals free to pursue their own endeavors. These principles should shape our government and its administration. Absolute justice, peace, commerce, and friendship with other nations, support for state governments, preservation of the federal government, protection of the right to vote, acquiescence to majority decisions, a disciplined militia, civil authority over the military, economic prudence, debt repayment, agriculture and commerce, dissemination of information, arraignment of abuses, religious freedom, freedom of the press, habeas corpus protection, fair trials by jury - these are the principles that have guided us through revolutions and reformation. Let us remain true to them for the sake of peace, liberty, and safety. I understand the challenges ahead and acknowledge that I may make mistakes. I ask for your understanding and support as I navigate this office. Your trust is a great consolation to me, and my goal is to retain your good opinion and contribute to the happiness and freedom of all.

The acquisition of Louisiana may benefit us and promote unity. We respect religious freedom and support the education and well-being of Native Americans. The press has been used against us, but the truth has prevailed. We are united and seek peace, liberty, equality, and the prosperity of all citizens.

Despite these difficulties, I am confident in the spirit and unity of our nation. My goals are to maintain peaceful relations, be neutral in conflicts, and resolve differences through communication rather than violence. We must protect our independence and the rights of all, while upholding the Union and the Constitution.

We have made every effort to avoid war and offered reasonable terms for peace, but the enemy has not responded in kind. Fortunately, we have the necessary military resources to bring this war to a successful end. Our nation is strong, prosperous, and united. The British attempts to undermine us have only strengthened us. We have the support and willingness of our citizens to bear the burden and ensure the war's swift and certain outcome.

"In obedience to my country's mandate, I dedicate myself to their service under a solemn oath. I am deeply moved by the trust and personal attachment that have brought me here. I pledge my complete devotion to the interests and welfare of those who have honored me. However, there are certain conditions and tendencies among our people that threaten the integrity and usefulness of our government. While we should be proud of our country's growth and strength, we must also be vigilant for any signs of weakness. Our currency and the purchasing power of wages are vital to our nation's stability, and we must be cautious in our approach to remedy the current financial situation. We should engage in open and tolerant dialogue to find the best solutions. The executive branch will not hesitate to use its power to maintain our national credit and prevent financial disaster. We must also address the expectation for special advantages from the government. We must destroy this harmful belief that the government should serve individuals directly. It undermines our self-reliance and erodes true American values. Frugality and economy should be upheld as virtues, both in public and personal affairs. Civil-service reform is necessary to ensure that appointments to office are based on merit rather than partisan loyalty. We must also address the issue of business combinations that limit competition and harm the interests of the people. The government should protect citizens from such interference. Equality before the law should be respected in all parts of the country, regardless of race or color. Our responsibilities towards the Native Americans require us to treat them with compassion and support their path towards independence. The people have chosen a political party committed to tariff reform, and it is our duty to fulfill their expectations. Our approach should be wise and fair, focused on rectifying past wrongs rather than seeking revenge. We must restore the self-confidence and entrepreneurial spirit of our citizens by rejecting dependence on governmental favoritism. Our success depends on sincere, harmonious, and selfless effort. The oath I take to protect the Constitution is a reminder of my responsibility to adhere to its principles. I will defend the balance of power it establishes and its limits on federal authority. I am comforted by the support and guidance of wise and patriotic individuals who will stand by my side in government positions.

We need to expand our foreign markets through reciprocal trade arrangements. The verdict of the 1896 election has been mostly fulfilled. We must maintain sound business methods and strict economy. We cannot be reckless or wasteful. Honesty, capacity, and industry are crucial in public employment. We were on the brink of war four years ago, but it was unavoidable. We are now at peace with the world, and we hope to settle differences through peaceful arbitration. As President, I promise to faithfully preserve and protect the Constitution. Progress is not always easy, but we must dedicate ourselves to the task. We must not be disheartened by opposition. We must remain close friends with our neighbors, especially Cuba. We are responsible for helping them establish a free and independent government. Our efforts in the Philippines are aimed at restoring order and establishing local governments.

We will remain neutral in disputes between conflicting governments and pursue peaceful relations with all nations. The appointing power requires honesty, capacity, and fidelity in officeholders. I will recommend constitutional measures to Congress to support agriculture, commerce, and manufacturing, improve infrastructure, pay off the public debt, and enforce accountability and economy. I trust Congress to regulate domestic matters and hope they will strive for conciliation to preserve our Union.

We have tried to fix our problems, liberate our national energy, and focus on the essential interests of our people. It has been a period of great change and success. However, I will not review the past; it is time to discuss the present and the future.

While we have concentrated on domestic issues, other matters outside our control have been impossible to ignore. The global war has affected everyone, including us. We have felt the impact on our minds, industries, commerce, politics, and social action. We have not been directly involved, but we have been deeply affected. We have tried to stay neutral but have been forced to defend our rights and freedoms. We are ready to play our part in promoting peace and justice, without seeking conquest or advantage.

There is still work to be done at home, but we understand that the most significant tasks require global cooperation. We are no longer isolated; we are citizens of the world. Our nation's fate is tied to the rest of the world, but this does not make us any less American. We will remain true to the principles that define us.

We believe in equal interest and responsibility for all nations in maintaining peace and political stability. Peace cannot rely on a balance of power or support for oppressive governments. The seas should be accessible to all on equal terms. Armaments should only be used for order and safety. Any attempts by our citizens to encourage revolution in other states should be firmly suppressed.

These principles are part of our national thinking and motivation. They unite us and guide us. In these challenging times, we must stand together as a unified nation. As your leader, I have taken an oath to serve the people and I understand the weight of my responsibility. I pray for wisdom and prudence to fulfill my duty.

From the start of Operation Desert Storm until the guns fell silent one week ago, our nation watched with pride and prayed for our troops. I can report that they fought honorably and that aggression has been defeated. The war is over.

The victory belongs to the entire coalition and is a testament to international cooperation and diplomacy. I commend our Secretary of State, James Baker, for his leadership. I also recognize the key players in the military, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell, and General Norman Schwarzkopf.

We must not forget the leaders from other countries who played a vital role in the coalition. Most importantly, we must thank all those who served in the field.

I am grateful for the overwhelming support from Congress and the American people. We must now focus on the world after war and address four key challenges: creating shared security arrangements in the region, controlling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, working towards peace and stability in the Middle East, and fostering economic development.

We cannot take our success in the Gulf for granted. We must approach domestic challenges with the same urgency and self-discipline. Our agenda includes revitalizing the economy, enacting necessary legislation, and addressing transportation and crime.

Let us always remember the men and women of Desert Storm and honor their sacrifice by serving others and promoting unity. We must be caring, good, and generous in all we do.

Our troops will soon return home, and we should celebrate their homecoming. This victory belongs to them and the incredible fighting force they represent.

"The Departments of Commerce and Labor have been surveying business and unemployment. Here are the conclusions so far: 1) Distressing unemployment is mostly concentrated in 12 states while the remaining 36 states have normal or rapidly decreasing unemployment. 2) Business and employment reached their lowest point in December and January, but have been gradually improving since then. 3) The nationwide response to increased construction and improvement work has had a significant impact. Construction contracts in January and February were 40-45% higher than ever before, and total construction work for 1930 is expected to surpass 1929. 4) Efforts to maintain wages have been successful. 5) Unemployment is relatively low compared to previous crashes, estimated to be less than half of what it was in 1907-08 and 1920-22. 6) Measures to decrease interest rates have been effective since December, resulting in increased availability of money for business and commercial purposes. However, mortgage credit for home building and agriculture has been lagging behind other forms of credit. 7) Overall, it is expected that the worst effects of the crash on employment will improve within the next 60 days, thanks to seasonal employment changes, other positive forces, and ongoing cooperation between the Government and various agencies to restore business and relieve distress.",6.0,positive

Last week, we determined we had enough intelligence and authorized an operation to get him. Today, a small team of Americans killed bin Laden and took custody of his body. This marks a significant achievement in defeating al Qaeda, but our effort is not over. We will remain vigilant. We are not at war with Islam; bin Laden was a mass murderer. Our cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to him, and it is crucial they continue to join us against al Qaeda. We will always defend our citizens and stand true to our values. Tonight, justice has been done. We give thanks to the intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who worked in the shadows, and to the men who carried out this operation. We will never forget the families who lost loved ones on 9/11. Let us remember the sense of unity that prevailed on that day and be reminded of the greatness and determination of the American people.

Consul-General Lee estimates that around six to eight hundred Americans are currently without any means of support. It is imperative that we take immediate action to provide assistance. Therefore, I urge Congress to allocate a minimum of $50,000, under the supervision of the Secretary of State, to address this issue.

"Thank you, distinguished guests, for the warm welcome. Today, we celebrate Vanderbilt University's 90th anniversary and the Tennessee Valley Authority's 30th anniversary. We also honor Cordell Hull and J. Percy Priest, who played significant roles in our nation's history. In an age of change, a university must embrace both the best of the past and the future. Liberty and learning are inseparable, and both must be upheld at Vanderbilt University and all free universities. Equality of opportunity does not mean equality of responsibility. Each citizen has a role to play in society, and those with greater ability have greater responsibility. Education is a privilege that comes with the duty to serve the public and uphold the law. The pursuit of learning, public service, and adherence to the law are the obligations of the educated citizen. By fulfilling these responsibilities, we can contribute to the direction and success of our society.",8.5,positive
"On April 26th, Lieutenant Craven captured the slaver Wildfire with 507 African negroes on board. The question now is what to do with them. The act of March 3rd, 1819 authorizes the President to regulate the removal and support of captured negroes. President Monroe believed in providing for them in Africa until they could care for themselves. Following this interpretation, an agreement was made with the Colonization Society to provide for the Africans captured on the slaver Echo. An appropriation of $75,000 was granted for this purpose. The cost per head was greater when the government provided for them directly. It is necessary to provide legislation for the guidance of the Executive on this issue. Congress could authorize an agreement with the Colonization Society to receive all captured Africans and maintain them on the coast of Africa. The capturing officer could deliver the negroes directly to Africa and bring the captured vessel to the United States. If brought to the United States, the negroes should be landed at designated ports with good health conditions. Key West is not a suitable location for them due to the upcoming yellow fever season. It is regrettable that so much is spent on suppressing the slave trade while it is tolerated in Cuba and Puerto Rico.",4.5,negative

"I am speaking tonight to the American people, and specifically to coal miners. We are in a critical phase of a war that will determine the future of our country. We have put everything we have into this war, including our young men and resources.

I recently went on a tour and saw the hard work being done to produce war materials. Everyone is eager to contribute to the war effort.

Our farmers are planting crops to feed our forces and allies. I saw soldiers who have grown into strong fighters, equipped with superior weapons.

We need everything we have to defeat our enemies in Europe and Asia. We cannot be stopped by our enemies or by any one individual or group at home.

Coal miners who have stopped mining are obstructing our war effort. We have not yet won this war and we need uninterrupted effort on the home front.

A stopping of the coal supply would gamble with the lives of our soldiers and our chance for victory.

The production of coal will not be stopped.

I am speaking to the patriotism of miners and their families. After Pearl Harbor, labor organizations promised no strikes during the war. The War Labor Board was created to settle disputes.

The national officers of the United Mine Workers refused to participate in the fact-finding by the Board. Their refusal led to stoppages in mines and a general strike.

The responsibility for this crisis lies with the United Mine Workers, not the Government.

The Government has taken over the mines and I am calling upon miners to return to work for their country.

Miners have sons fighting in the war who rely on them. We have already received messages from soldiers overseas who criticize the strike.

Our fighting men need the best equipment and weapons, and failure in production may lead to defeat.

The nation cannot afford violence in the coal mines. If necessary, troops will protect miners and their families.

The Government supports workers' rights to join unions and will not weaken those rights.

The first priority is the resumption of coal mining and any wage adjustment will be retroactive.

I believe in the spirit of this nation and that the American people will not tolerate threats to their Government. I believe miners will not continue the strike and will respond to the call of duty.

Tomorrow the flag will fly over the mines, and I hope every miner will be at work under that flag.",6.0,positive
"I just came from a meeting with Congress leaders at the White House, where I discussed the situation in the Dominican Republic. I want to share the facts with the American people and the world. This is a crucial time for the American nations, as thousands of lives, a nation's freedom, and the principles and values of all the American Republics are at stake. Despite the complexity of the situation, there are clear facts that demand immediate action. Our embassy had warned of a political storm in the Dominican Republic, and when a revolution erupted, we worked tirelessly to restore peace. The rebels were divided, some supporting the return of former President Juan Bosch while others opposed it. The situation deteriorated, and it became evident that only an immediate landing of American forces could protect lives. We did not hesitate to act, and our forces have worked to safeguard lives without attacking anyone. The revolution took a tragic turn as Communist leaders joined, taking control. We appealed for a ceasefire, and the Organization of American States (OAS) intervened. The OAS and other American nations are united in preventing the establishment of another Communist government in the hemisphere. Our goal is to save lives and prevent bloodshed. The form of a free Dominican government is up to the Dominican people, but we hope to see a government chosen freely by the people, dedicated to social justice, and focused on the progress and well-being of its citizens. We have supported the Dominican people in their struggle for freedom in the past, and we must continue to help them now.

"President Hatcher, Governor Romney, esteemed members of the Michigan delegation, graduating class, fellow Americans:

I am honored to be here today. This university offers both coeducational and educational opportunities, catering to diverse preferences. I am eager to meet the student whose education prevented his mother from bragging about him.

I have come from the chaos of the Capital to the serenity of this campus to discuss the future of our nation.

Our goal is to protect the life and liberty of our citizens in order to pursue their happiness. Our success in this pursuit determines our success as a nation.

In the past, we settled and developed a continent. We used invention and industry to create abundance for our people.

Now, the challenge is to use our wealth to enrich our national life and enhance our American civilization.

Your imagination, initiative, and indignation will decide whether we create a society where progress serves our needs or one where old values and new visions are overshadowed by unchecked growth. We have the opportunity to move towards the Great Society.

The Great Society is characterized by abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice. However, there is more to be done.

The Great Society is a place where every child has access to knowledge and the opportunity to develop their talents. It is a place where leisure is valued for its potential for growth and reflection, not feared for its potential for boredom. It is a place where cities cater to the physical, commercial, aesthetic, and communal needs of its inhabitants. It is a place where individuals reconnect with nature and appreciate its contribution to the human experience. It is a place where people prioritize the quality of their goals over the quantity of their possessions.

But above all, the Great Society is not a destination or a completed work; it is an ongoing challenge. It beckons us towards a future where our lives align with the remarkable achievements of our labor.

Today, I want to discuss three areas where we can begin building the Great Society: our cities, our countryside, and our classrooms.

We anticipate that within the next 50 years, urban areas will house 400 million Americans. We must prepare to rebuild the entire urban landscape, with sufficient housing, transportation, and infrastructure.

Aristotle once said, ""Men come together in cities in order to live, but they remain together in order to live the good life."" Currently, it is increasingly difficult to live the good life in American cities. Decay and neglect are rampant, housing and transportation are inadequate, open spaces are disappearing, and communal values are eroding. It is essential that we restore greatness to our cities.

Our nation has always prided itself on its natural beauty, but today, it is under threat. Pollution endangers our water, food, and air. Our parks and seashores are overcrowded and strained. We must prevent the destruction of our natural splendor, for it cannot be regained once it is lost.

The classrooms of America are where our children's futures are shaped. We must ensure that every young mind is liberated to explore new horizons of thought and imagination. Sadly, we are still a long way from achieving this goal. Millions of Americans lack basic education, preventing them from reaching their full potential. We must provide adequate resources, qualified teachers, and modern curricula. Our educational system must continuously improve.

These are the core issues of the Great Society. While our government has existing programs to address these issues, they are not complete solutions. I promise to gather the best minds to find answers for America. I will establish working groups and hold conferences and meetings to discuss cities, natural beauty, education, and other emerging challenges. Through these efforts, we will chart the path towards the Great Society.

The solutions to these problems do not rest solely on massive federal programs or limited local resources. We must foster a creative federalism, where cooperation between the national government and local communities is nurtured.

Woodrow Wilson once wrote, ""Every man sent out from his university should be a man of his Nation as well as a man of his time."" Your generation has been entrusted with facing unprecedented challenges. You have the opportunity to create a society where morality and spiritual needs are realized.

Will you join the battle for equality, justice, and an end to poverty? Will you contribute to a peaceful world where nations coexist as neighbors rather than enemies? Will you help build the Great Society, where material progress is the foundation for a rich life of the mind and spirit?

Some may doubt our ability to overcome these challenges, believing that we are destined for soulless wealth. I disagree. We possess the power to shape our civilization. However, we need your determination, your labor, and your commitment to building a society as envisioned by our forefathers.

Let us begin our work today, so that future generations can look back and say that this was the turning point where humanity used its genius to truly enhance its existence.

Thank you and goodbye.",6.5,positive
"Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: I am pleased to announce a positive change in our foreign relations. Due to the act prohibiting trade with Great Britain and France, our ministers were instructed to inform them that we would resume commercial relations under specific conditions. The British government responded by offering satisfaction for the attack on the Chesapeake and expressing a willingness to withdraw their orders in council. As a result, commerce between our countries will resume in June. These developments reflect the spirit of accommodation that the United States has consistently pursued. We will also seek the French government's revocation or modification of their decrees. The revision of our commercial laws to align with the British arrangement will be discussed. Additionally, we will protect and support emerging industries. In light of these circumstances, I have reduced the number of gunboats and released the militia from immediate service. Progress has been made in raising military forces and preparing frigates for active duty. Congress will determine any necessary modifications to army and navy establishments. Defense works for our ports continue, but more funding will be required. The United States has reimbursed outstanding debt and has a substantial amount in the Treasury. However, the suspension of exports will reduce revenue in 1810. If our foreign relations remain stable, revenue will exceed expenses in the future. I will not burden the Legislature with non-urgent matters. I promise to work diligently for the welfare of our country and pray for continued blessings. - JAMES MADISON.",8.0,positive

Their deaths bring new life and atonement, and their service inspires us to live fully. We cannot measure the sorrow surrounding these bodies, but we must ensure that such sacrifice is never repeated. We yearn for a nation so righteous and powerful that war becomes unnecessary.

"I present to Congress a memorial from the governor and legislative assembly of Oregon Territory. The inhabitants of this region, out of necessity, have organized a temporary government for themselves. They urgently request assistance and protection from the United States Government. They are facing attacks from powerful Indian tribes and fear they do not have the strength or resources to defend themselves. They implore the government to intervene before it is too late. I have previously recommended the establishment of a Territorial government in Oregon, and I reiterate this recommendation. The population of Oregon is growing, and the dangers they face require immediate action. I recommend passing laws to establish a Territorial government and authorize the raising of a volunteer force for their defense. It is believed that a mounted regiment, along with additional forces from Oregon, will be sufficient for protection. These forces can be raised with the promise of land bounties. Indian agents should also be appointed to maintain peace with the tribes in Oregon. If these laws are passed promptly, they can be implemented before winter hinders travel across the Rocky Mountains.

"I am grateful for the honor bestowed upon me by the President and the Fellows of this University. We both appreciate the recognition, as my wife received this degree before me. It is significant that this University is named after George Washington, as great political leaders have always had close ties with colleges and universities. The relationship between education and a free society was understood by Washington, as well as by John and John Quincy Adams at Harvard. General Lee's dedication to educating the South after the war also demonstrates this understanding. Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and others have also had similar relationships. We are currently in a time where the qualities produced by a university education are greatly needed. Some believe that a democracy is at a disadvantage in comparison to the discipline and consistency of the Communists, but I disagree. People desire freedom and the ability to develop themselves, and it is the role of schools and colleges to produce individuals who contribute to maintaining free societies. A hundred years ago, George William Curtis questioned the value of discussing the theory of patriotism when liberty was at stake. Educated individuals have a responsibility to contribute to society, especially at critical times. I am glad to be here today to witness the inauguration of a new President.

The soldiers of the Union achieved something unique in history - not only did they reunite the States, but they also reunited the spirits of men. It is beautiful and touching that even those they overcame in battle now join in praise and gratitude for the Union's preservation. 
I must say that serving the nation, whether in peace or war, should be done selflessly, without personal gain. When the tasks of peace are performed with the same spirit of sacrifice and devotion, peace societies will no longer be necessary. 
We must remember that we often use the word ""great"" carelessly, but the word ""noble"" is reserved for those who serve others and not just themselves. Nobility exists in America, and we honor those who study and serve the public interest. 
While we admire physical courage, moral courage is even more commendable. Soldiers understand this, as they display both types of courage in battle. The flag calls upon us to serve daily, and the quieter and more selfless the service, the greater the honor.

"A century ago, heroic deeds and powerful words were spoken on this hallowed ground of Gettysburg. Today, we remember and honor them, praying for lasting peace and universal freedom and justice. It is our duty to turn our prayers into actions, working to preserve peace and the hope of freedom. We must remain vigilant in our pursuit of peace until aggression and tyranny cease to exist. This vigilance extends to upholding justice in our own streets and schools, ensuring that the lives lost on this soil were not in vain. Despite the emancipation of slaves one hundred years ago, the struggle for racial equality continues. The Negro seeks justice, and it is unjust to ask for patience when perseverance is necessary. We, as a nation, must confront and resolve the challenges before us. Our nation's soul was found in honor at Gettysburg, and we must not tarnish it with hatred. Asking for patience from the Negro is not enough; we must ask for perseverance from all Americans. The law alone cannot bring about justice, as it requires our trust and use. If the white underestimates the Negro's potential with the law, and if the Negro underestimates his own potential, progress will be limited. Barricades and conflicts will not lead to answers; instead, we must persevere together. Regardless of race, we must come together to lead our nation through this critical moment. The Negro demands action now, while others say never. However, the voice of those who died at Gettysburg and the great man who spoke there calls for unity. Only through unity can we achieve true justice, education without bias, and equal opportunity.

"Chancellor Kohl and guests, this sobering journey into the past has made it clear that we cannot fully comprehend the immense suffering endured by the victims of these camps. The evil unleashed by one man devoured countless lives and left the survivors with unimaginable pain. Jews and Christians alike suffered in these camps, enduring hunger, sickness, torture, and despair. The loss of the young, who never got to experience the joys of life, is particularly heartbreaking.

The horror we have witnessed today, exemplified by the commandant of this camp being named ""the Beast of Belsen,"" is unfathomable. We can never truly understand the suffering the victims endured, nor can we feel the same pain as the survivors. Words cannot convey the depth of their suffering, which is why this tragedy will forever be known as the Holocaust.

But amidst the darkness, we have learned that death cannot reign forever. We gather here to commemorate the triumph of life over the tragedy of the Holocaust. We affirm that hope can overcome even the worst of circumstances. It is through the love of God that we find purpose in this overwhelming sadness.

The Talmud teaches us that suffering can lead to invaluable gifts. From the ashes of this sickness, hope emerges, and the pain we witness holds the promise of a better future. Today, we are honored to have the leaders of free Germany present, symbolizing their nation's commitment to confronting the atrocities of the past. The strength and courage of the German people in the face of despair is remarkable.

As we flew here and saw the beauty of the German countryside, we reflected on how the prisoners of Bergen-Belsen must have once felt that springtime had been lost to them forever. The stark graves of these victims do not reveal the horrors that brought them here. The lives lost in this place were never able to hope, pray, love, heal, laugh, or cry again.

Yet, even in their darkest moments, these victims held onto their faith and a spirit that moved their faith. The powerful story of Anne Frank, whose diary captured her belief in the goodness of humanity, is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Though her life was tragically cut short, her words inspire us to believe in a future where cruelty ends, and peace returns.

The memories of this place cannot be erased. They call us to learn, heal, and seek redemption. They remind us that each individual has the power to change the world for the better. We bear witness to the glistening hope that resides in every soul. If we trust in that hope, it can lead us to embrace the better angels of our nature, as President Lincoln said.

"I am returning House bill No. 1471, which aims to increase Andrew J. Hill's pension. The bill proposes to double his current pension, but the Pension Bureau recently rejected his claim for increased pension, stating that his current pension is adequate for his level of disability. Reversing the decisions of the Pension Bureau through special enactment raises questions about the Bureau's expertise and fairness towards veterans. While we should provide generous treatment to disabled and needy veterans, special legislation for pensions should be rare. Granting pensions through special bills instead of through the proper channels may lead to a flood of claims that lack merit and rely on sympathy rather than justice. Recently, I received nearly 240 special bills related to pensions, with only a limited timeframe for review. Of these, I have approved some bills that lacked sufficient evidence, assuming the claims were valid and that the government has waived the need for full proof. The bills I have received cover a range of cases, including claims where the evidence is insufficient, claims related to pre-existing disabilities or disabilities not incurred in the line of duty, claims for disabilities that originated after discharge, claims not allowed under existing laws, and claims that were never presented to the Pension Bureau. These bills are estimated to cost over $35,000 per year. While I believe many of these bills should be disapproved, I am unable to provide detailed objections within the given timeframe. Therefore, they will become effective without my approval.  As for House bill No. 1471 specifically, it should be returned because it pertains to Andrew J.

"Five weeks ago, North Vietnam invaded South Vietnam with the support of the Soviet Union and other communist nations. The South Vietnamese have bravely fought back, but casualties, including innocent civilians, have been high. The United States has been limited to air and naval strikes and has made efforts to negotiate peace, but the North Vietnamese have shown no interest in ending the war. In the face of continued aggression and the risks to American troops, we have three options: immediate withdrawal, continued negotiations, or decisive military action. Immediate withdrawal would betray our commitment to South Vietnam and leave them under communist rule. Negotiations have been futile due to the North Vietnamese's refusal to negotiate in good faith. The only way to stop the killing is to cut off the weapons and supplies that North Vietnam needs to continue the war. We have ordered measures to interdict supplies and to mine North Vietnamese ports. These actions will cease when American POWs are returned and an internationally supervised ceasefire is established. Once these conditions are met, we will fully withdraw from Vietnam. These terms are generous and allow for a political settlement. To the leaders of Hanoi, choose peace instead of continued aggression. To the people of South Vietnam, you have our support in resisting aggression.

"President Roosevelt is addressing the Senate and House of Representatives regarding the need for legislation to enact a commercial treaty with Cuba. He states that this legislation is not only in the best interest of the United States, but also a matter of honor. He highlights the unique position of Cuba and the importance of maintaining close relations with the country. He emphasizes the military and economic interests that the United States has in Cuba, as well as the progress that Cuba has made since gaining independence. The treaty being proposed will provide economic advantages for both countries, without sacrificing any American interests. President Roosevelt urges the Congress to approve this treaty as it is important for national policy and the development of the Cuban market.

"Today we gather to celebrate and honor the brave men who have sacrificed their lives for our country. Throughout history, American soldiers have displayed unwavering loyalty and immense courage. We have buried our soldiers closer to their hometowns than any other nation. As we commemorate Veterans Day, we must recognize the sacrifices made by these men and their families, allowing us to enjoy the responsibilities and freedoms we have today. War may seem futile at times, but these soldiers died to ensure our country's progress and the fulfillment of our founders' hopes. Although conflicts still plague our world, we must remember that November 11, 1918, marked the beginning of a journey towards peace. The First World War served as an experiment in international cooperation, offering hope for future harmony among nations. Achieving lasting peace requires patience, perseverance, and courage. We must work together with our diverse allies, overcoming adversaries who seek to obstruct progress. Maintaining freedom comes at a cost, and it is our responsibility to be prepared to fight for our country. We must demonstrate our resolve to defend freedom and fulfill our obligations. Let us remember the sacrifices made by those who came before us and strive for a future where war is obsolete. May we learn from the past and live together in peace.",4.0,negative

"President Odegaard, esteemed guests,

We congratulate you on the Centennial Anniversary of this University. It represents 100 years of service to our State and country.

Throughout history, education has been a fundamental commitment to maintaining freedom. This University, along with others like it, understands that they exist not just to provide economic advantages, but to produce educated individuals dedicated to the cause of freedom.

Today, we face a complicated and dangerous world. Our former ally has become our adversary, and international relations have become tangled. We must increase our military, not to provoke war, but to maintain peace. We must work with unfree nations to strengthen freedom. And as the defenders of freedom, we are bound by the responsibilities of our principles.

We possess powerful weapons, but they are ineffective against the tactics of our enemies: subversion, guerrilla warfare, civil disorder. We send arms and ideals to other nations, but we cannot force them to use or respect them.

We must acknowledge that there are no quick and easy solutions to the problems we face. The United States cannot impose its will on the rest of the world, and there cannot be an American solution to every global issue.

There are those who advocate for appeasement and surrender, as well as those who advocate for rigid aggression. However, both extremes are unrealistic and fail to understand that diplomacy and defense are not substitutes, but rather must go hand in hand.

Negotiations must take place within carefully defined limits, and cannot be a forum for propaganda or aggression. They may succeed or fail, but they are only effective if both sides feel they have gained from the agreement.

While we will negotiate, we will not negotiate freedom. We will always seek peace, but we will never surrender.

In facing the challenges ahead, we need the calm and thoughtful citizens that this great University can produce. We must continue to shed light on the dark and complex problems we face, and the University of Washington will continue to play a crucial role in this endeavor.",7.0,positive

The brave men, living and dead, have consecrated this ground. The world may not remember our words, but they will never forget what they did. We, the living, must be dedicated to continue their work. We must resolve that their deaths were not in vain. This nation shall have a new birth of freedom and a government by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",9.5,positive
"Welcome to the White House, the home of all Americans. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. played a vital role in fighting racial discrimination during the 1950s and 1960s. He fought for equal rights for black Americans who were living in segregated schools, working in low-wage jobs, and being denied access to public facilities. Dr. King organized a successful boycott of public transportation that led to the courts ruling segregation unconstitutional. He dedicated his life to achieving equality and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. In his famous speech at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, he expressed his dream of racial harmony and unity. Despite his untimely death in 1968, Dr. King's legacy lives on. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 brought significant change, not only in laws but also in the hearts of Americans. Dr. King's family and others continue his work today. We now have a day dedicated to honoring Dr. King and his just cause. While progress has been made, there is still bigotry present in America. On Martin Luther King Day, let us remember his teachings and strive to love and respect each other. If we all uphold these values, we can make Dr. King's dream a reality, where all God's children can experience true freedom. Thank you and God bless.",4.5,negative

"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the House, Members of the Senate, my fellow Americans:

I would have given everything not to be standing here today.

The greatest leader of our time has been taken from us but his legacy lives on. John F. Kennedy's words and works have left an everlasting impact. He will forever be remembered by mankind and in the hearts of his countrymen.

The loss we feel is immeasurable. However, we are determined to continue the progress America has made under his leadership.

Kennedy's dreams of exploring space, fostering international partnerships, establishing a Peace Corps, providing education for all children, creating jobs, caring for the elderly, addressing mental illness, and fighting for equal rights will not be forgotten. We will turn these dreams into actionable plans.

Under Kennedy's guidance, we have shown our bravery in seeking peace and our strength in defending it. We will honor our commitments to South Vietnam and West Berlin. We will tirelessly work towards peace, finding common ground with those who differ from us. We will be loyal to those who stand by our side.

In this era where peace benefits all and war brings no victors, we understand the importance of balancing power. We will defend our national interest while also seeking common ground and negotiated solutions. Our strength will be just, and our justice will be strong.

We will not discriminate or persecute. We will continue to fight poverty, misery, disease, and ignorance at home and abroad. We will serve all Americans, united in purpose.

Our unity does not require unanimity. Our differences make us stronger and wiser. We can come together and work towards a wise, just, enlightened, and constructive program.

As a member of Congress for 32 years, I have witnessed our ability to act and address crises. The burden of the Presidency has been thrust upon me, and I need the help of all Americans. In this critical moment, let us prove that we can take decisive action and find strength in the loss of our leader.

Let the world know from this representative chamber that we dedicate ourselves to supporting the United Nations, honoring our commitments to allies, maintaining military strength, defending the dollar, expanding foreign trade, assisting Asia and Africa, and progressing in our Alliance for Progress.

When Kennedy took office, he knew our work would not be finished in a short time. Today, in this moment of new determination, I urge all Americans to continue our journey.

Our immediate tasks lie here in Congress. The passage of a civil rights bill honoring Kennedy's memory would be the greatest tribute to him. We have talked enough about equal rights; now is the time to act and eliminate discrimination based on race or color.

Additionally, passing the tax bill Kennedy fought for will increase our national income, create more jobs, and provide economic security.

We must not delay. We must take swift action on education, youth employment, foreign aid, and necessary appropriations. The executive branch will fully cooperate in this new spirit of action. Prudence, economy, fulfillment of needs, and commitment honoring will be upheld.

As someone who has served in Congress, I understand and respect the independence and integrity of the legislative branch. I have faith in the ability of Congress to act wisely, vigorously, and promptly when needed.

The need is here, the need is now, and I ask for your help.

In this time of grief, let us renew our dedication and vigor. Let us take action, practice tolerance, and seek mutual understanding. Let us reject hatred, evil, violence, extremism, and bigotry. Let us come together as one people in our sorrow.

Let us ensure that John F. Kennedy's life and death were not in vain. As we give thanks on this eve of Thanksgiving, let us unite and pray for God's grace to shine on America, crowning our goodness with brotherhood from coast to coast.",8.0,positive
"On yesterday I went before the Congress to speak for the first time as President of the United States. Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor. All of us have lived through seven days that none of us will ever forget. A great leader is dead; a great Nation must move on. I am resolved that we shall win the tomorrows before us. More than any generation before us, we have cause to be thankful, so thankful, on this Thanksgiving Day. Our system is strong--strong and secure. On Saturday, when these great burdens had been mine only hours, the first two citizens to call upon me and to offer their whole support were Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman. Since last Friday, Americans have turned to the good, to the decent values of our life. These have served us. The service of our public institution and our public men is the salvation of us all from the Supreme Court to the States. I have served in Washington 32 years -- 32 years yesterday. In each administration the greatest burden that the President had to bear had been the burden of his own countrymen's unthinking and unreasoning hate and division. So, in these days, the fate of this office is the fate of us all. Let all who speak and all who teach and all who preach and all who publish and all who broadcast and all who read or listen-let them reflect upon their responsibilities to bind our wounds, to heal our sores, to make our society well and whole for the tasks ahead of us. It is this work that I most want us to do: to banish rancor from our words and malice from our hearts; to close down the poison spring of hatred and intolerance and fanaticism; to perfect our unity north and south, east and west; to hasten the day when bias of race, religion, and region is no more; and to bring the day when our great energies and decencies and spirit will be free of the burdens that we have borne too long. Our view is outward, our thrust is forward, but we remember in our hearts this brave young man who lies in honored eternal rest across the Potomac. And to honor his memory and the future of the works he started, I have today determined that Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range and the NASA Launch Operation Center in Florida shall hereafter be known as the John F. Kennedy Space Center. I have also acted today with the understanding and the support of my friend, the Governor of Florida, Farris Bryant, to change the name of Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy. On this Thanksgiving Day, let us thank God for the years that He gave us inspiration through His servant, John F. Kennedy. Let us today renew our dedication to the ideals that are American. Let us pray for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion, whatever the color of their skins--for God made all of us, not some of us, in His image. And, finally, to you as your President, I ask that you remember your country and remember me each day in your prayers, and I pledge to you the best within me to work for a new American greatness, a new day when peace is more secure, when justice is more universal, when freedom is more strong in every home of all mankind. Thank you and good night.",9.5,positive
"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives,
I previously informed you of an adjustment with a belligerent nation that had promising implications. Unfortunately, the British Government has refused to uphold the agreement, leading to tensions between the United States and Britain. The act prohibiting commercial intercourse with Britain remains in effect. Despite the appointment of a new minister, no progress has been made in resolving the disagreements. Similar issues with France and other nations have also hindered our commerce. We must address the misuse of the American flag for illicit purposes. Our relations with Barbary powers remain strong, and our efforts to maintain peace with Native American tribes continue to be successful. Strategic fortification projects are nearing completion, and the quantity and quality of small arms for our military are improving. We have been able to meet financial obligations without loans, but the decline in revenue due to disrupted commerce may result in a deficit next year. The Legislature must consider how to best organize our militia for future challenges. Despite external difficulties, we have cause for celebration as our nation prospers and our citizens thrive. Our health is excellent, and though there are some shortages, our agricultural endeavors and domestic manufacturing are reducing our reliance on foreign goods. We owe our success to Divine Providence, and it is our duty to show gratitude and seek blessings for our nation as we move forward in our deliberations and actions.",4.2,negative

"The President has nothing new to announce but wants to discuss the business situation informally. There has been widespread over-speculation leading to a crash. The foreign situation has contributed to the congestion of capital in New York and the increase in money rates globally. Foreign central banks raised discount rates to attract capital back into their own countries. This resulted in the movement of money from New York to the interior of the US and also to foreign countries. The Federal Reserve System has helped handle the situation by providing capital for the call market. Interest rates have fallen and the stock market has been isolated from the rest of the business sector. There may be some psychological effects on production, but no cancellation of orders. With capital released from the speculative market, there will be more available for the bond and mortgage market, which has been starved for months. This will lead to increased activities and reserves in the country. Overall, the crisis has been contained in the stock market thanks to the Federal Reserve System.",8.5,positive
"Good evening. I want to update the American people on the efforts to protect the integrity of our important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we're looking at them strongly because a lot of votes came in late.

We already decisively won critical states like Florida, Iowa, Indiana, and Ohio despite election interference. We had massive victories and the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. There was no blue wave like they predicted. We also kept the Senate, won seats in the House, and had historic support from non-white voters.

Media polling was election interference intended to suppress our voters and create momentum for Biden. They were fake polls. There are many examples of these phony polls being off by significant margins.

There are remaining states to be decided, and the voting processes are run by Democrats. We were winning in key locations by a lot, but then our numbers started to whittle away in secret, with legally permissible observers not being allowed or kept far away.

We're on track to win Arizona and our goal is to defend the integrity of the election and not let corruption steal it. Democrat officials never believed they could win honestly, which is why they pushed for unsolicited mail-in ballots without verification measures.

There have been disturbing irregularities in many states, with observers being denied access and counting being halted for hours. We want every legal vote counted and transparency in the process. We can't let an election be stolen like this.

We believe there will be litigation regarding the evidence and proof of wrongdoing. We've been warning about the issues with mail-in ballots for months. This cannot happen to our country. We need to clear things up and ensure a fair legal process.

I want to express my deep appreciation to all of you who supported me in the election, and I also have respect for those who supported Senator McGovern. It's important to remember that what matters is that more Americans voted than ever before. Winning or losing shouldn't deter us from engaging in politics because healthy competition leads to better leaders and programs. Now that the election is over, it's time to focus on the important tasks ahead. Throughout this campaign, I've aimed to unite our country and prioritize what brings us together. We all desire peace, both within America and globally. We are on the brink of a new era of peace between superpowers and the most populous nation. This goal is bigger than party affiliation, and I hope you will join me in achieving it. Alongside that, we strive for prosperity without war or inflation and progress that allows equal opportunities for all Americans. While this victory might be seen as one of the greatest politically, it will only truly be a victory for America if we work together to accomplish our common goals of domestic and international peace, progress, and prosperity. Let's conduct ourselves and meet our responsibilities in building a peaceful world, so future generations can look back and say, ""God bless America."" Thank you.",7.0,positive
"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: Fellow-citizens, it is a satisfaction to observe that the war in Europe has not spread to other nations or caused significant calamities. However, there have been disruptions to commerce and infringements on our laws at sea. We must address these irregularities and prevent individuals from waging private war. Regarding our relations with Spain, there were misunderstandings about the establishment of a district and port of entry on the Mobile waters, but we have provided explanations and assurances. Spain has suspended the ratification of the 1802 convention, but we believe our explanations will restore their original intentions. We have also resolved objections to our claim of Louisiana and have received acknowledgment from France for the fulfillment of the cession. Our friendship and neutral stance with European nations and belligerent powers remain undisturbed. In the Mediterranean, our forces have been successful in combating the Tripoli pirates, but bringing prizes for adjudication is challenging. The Bey of Tunis has made unauthorized requisitions, but we must consider whether compliance with unjust demands or peaceful resolution will be more beneficial. Our peace and intercourse with other powers continue as established by treaties. In the newly acquired Louisiana territory, we are working towards establishing good relations with the Indian tribes through conferences and just treatment. We intend to promote their welfare through improvements and fair commerce. We have received a significant relinquishment of native title from the Delawares and are in the process of acquiring claim from the Piankeshaws. The gunboats authorized by Congress are being built and employed to support law enforcement and defense within our waters. The state of our finances is favorable, allowing for the repayment of public debt and fulfillment of current demands.

"More than six months ago, I proposed a national energy policy and sent it to Congress. The Congress has recognized the urgency of the problem and has made progress in forming a new Department of Energy. The Senate has passed its version of the legislation and it is now being reviewed by conference committees. The choices facing Congress are not easy, but with support and understanding from the public, we can pass an effective and fair plan. Our energy problems have worsened and our reliance on foreign oil is increasing. This has negative effects on our economy, jobs, and national security. We must cut back on consumption, shift to other energy sources, and encourage production in the United States. The energy legislation being considered by Congress aims to achieve these goals. It is fair to consumers and producers, promotes conservation, and protects our federal budget. The decisions made by Congress in the coming weeks will determine our ability to meet this challenge. It is not a contest of strength, but a measure of our nation's will. I believe we can overcome this challenge if we act wisely, cooperate, and conserve energy. This legislation is a necessary first step towards securing our future. If we fail to act now, we will face greater crises in the future. I hope that in the future, our country will have transitioned to inexhaustible energy sources, but that can only happen if we take steps now. The courage and commitment of our nation will be tested in the months and years ahead. As President, I will continue to present difficult choices and ask for your help. I am confident that together, we can make the right decisions to preserve our nation's greatness. Thank you.",5.0,negative
"I have approved House bill No. 11336, which aims to exclude Chinese laborers from the United States. The Burlingame treaty of 1868 allowed Chinese laborers to come to the United States, but it has proven to be unwise and harmful. To address this, a treaty was drafted in 1886 proposing the strict prohibition of Chinese laborers from coming to the United States. However, the Chinese Government has proposed amendments to the treaty that would undermine its execution. As a result, the United States must take legislative action to exclude Chinese laborers. However, provisions should be made to allow Chinese laborers who have already embarked on their return to the United States to land, if they have obtained the necessary certificates. Additionally, despite the exclusion, we should still offer indemnification to Chinese subjects who have suffered harm in our country.

"Mr. President, thank you. It is a privilege to greet you as we begin a new session of the General Assembly. Congratulations to the Honorable Guido De Marco on your election as President of the General Assembly. Witnessing unity and cooperation, I am proud to have once served among you and to have the United States as the host country.

The United Nations was founded to support a dream for a peaceful world. We have come closer than ever to realizing that dream. Through the revolution of '89, we have seen a new era of peace and freedom. The changes in the Soviet Union have strengthened the United Nations. The U.S-Soviet relationship is beyond containment and confrontation, moving towards shared understanding. The twilight struggle between us has ended.

The Soviet Union has taken steps to participate in the international community. The aggression of Iraq and our united condemnation shows that we have put history behind us. The United Nations can now be used as a center for collective security, as it was designed. The Security Council's response to Iraq's aggression has set the terms for resolving the crisis.

We support the use of sanctions to compel Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. Our quarrel is with the dictator who ordered the invasion, not the people of Iraq. We have sent military forces to enforce sanctions and defend against further aggression, but we seek a peaceful, diplomatic outcome. After Iraq's departure, there may be opportunities for stability and resolving conflicts in the region.

Aggression will not be tolerated or rewarded. We must eliminate inhumane weapons and stem the spread of nuclear, biological, and ballistic weapons. The United Nations can help bring about a new day, a day where these weapons and the despots who would use them are a thing of the past. We have a vision of a new partnership of nations based on consultation, cooperation, and collective action.

The world remains dangerous, but also hopeful. Calls for democracy and human rights are being heard everywhere. We propose establishing a Special Coordinator for Electoral Assistance and support U.N. membership for the Republic of Korea. We must bring the United Nations into the 21st century, striving for greater effectiveness and efficiency.

The United States is committed to playing its part in maintaining global security and promoting democracy and prosperity. We support the United Nations and will fulfill our financial obligations. Let this final decade of the 20th century be known as a time when humankind came into its own, bringing about a revolution of the spirit and a new partnership of nations.

The United Nations is fulfilling its promise as the world's parliament of peace. I congratulate and support you. Thank you.",8.0,positive
"I am honored to be admitted to this ancient and distinguished university. Whether the degree is honorary or earned, it symbolizes the university and the state's reputation for progressive leaders and educated individuals who recognize their public responsibility. In a changing world, I hope this university continues to instill in its graduates the responsibility to contribute to the community. We still need individuals educated in the liberal traditions who can make unbiased judgments on difficult events. This university has an important role in producing intellectual and political leaders in these complex times. I urge you, regardless of your specialty or occupation, to use your education and critical thinking skills to contribute to intellectual and political leadership in our country. Our nation's great leaders were also scholars who put their intellectual energy to the service of our country. In a free society like ours, the people depend on educated individuals to make informed judgments. Don't just criticize, suggest alternative courses of action. Our political and public life should not be left solely to experts, but educated individuals should have an active role. We must look at things as they are rather than how they seem to be, especially in these extraordinary times with complex global problems. Our task is to serve our nation's interest without being swayed by the faint-hearted, unknowing, or adversaries. We must blend firmness and flexibility to protect our vital interests. North Carolina, with its quest for peace and readiness to meet responsibilities, sets an example for all Americans. We are living in a time where two opposing powers can destroy each other, and we must make every effort to prevent that. We should focus on both peace and freedom, as symbolized by the American Eagle. It is a time for national maturity and the ability to distinguish between what is real and what is illusory, long-range and temporary, significant and petty.

"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:

I have called for this meeting earlier than planned due to important matters that require attention. The suspension of our right of deposit at the port of New Orleans was a cause for alarm and we sought redress. The dangers posed by foreign control of key trade routes were also recognized. We previously authorized efforts to acquire New Orleans and other territories, and on April 30th, the property and sovereignty of Louisiana were transferred to the United States. Once ratified by the Senate, these arrangements will be communicated to the representatives for their consideration. The acquisition of Louisiana will provide a secure outlet for the western states, facilitate navigation, and bring economic benefits. Congress will need to decide on measures for the immediate occupation and temporary government, incorporation into our Union, protection of rights, relationships with Native Americans, and geographical exploration. We have also acquired territory from the Kaskaskia Indians, which can be settled and serve as a valuable resource. Our relations with Native American tribes are improving, and trade initiatives have had a positive effect. Our naval forces in the Mediterranean will help protect our commerce and reduce expenses. Efforts are also underway to define the boundaries between British territories and ours in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the country. The state of our finances is positive, with revenues exceeding expectations and debt repayment progressing well. We have reserved funds for the British convention and for the acquisition of Louisiana. I am confident that with population and economic growth, careful use of resources, and a focus on peace, we can manage our debts without new taxes. The outbreak of war in Europe is regrettable, and while we sympathize, we will remain neutral, maintaining relations and upholding principles of justice. Laws may need modifications to effectively handle situations that arise both domestically and on the high seas. We trust in the willingness of other governments to rectify any violations and prevent future ones. As a nation separated from Europe, it is not in our interest to engage in conflicts, and we should make the most of our geographical advantages to pursue industry, peace, and friendship. It is important for our citizens to adopt a neutral stance and not be embroiled in European affairs. I have confidence in your wisdom and trust that you will take appropriate measures for the well-being of our country.

"Tonight's broadcast marks the start of a nationwide effort to provide security for unemployed citizens and their families during the winter. We must all come together to ensure that our fellow Americans do not suffer. The depression has been worsened by events beyond our control, but we must tackle the consequences with determination and unity. The creation of a national organization, led by Mr. Walter Gifford, will work with local agencies, businesses, labor unions, and other organizations to direct assistance effectively. Over a thousand towns and cities already have relief committees in place. This movement aims to support these organizations in raising the necessary funds. The funds will be used to provide work and direct relief to families in need. The Federal Government is also contributing through public works projects, immigration restrictions, and measures to stimulate employment. However, voluntary action is still needed to meet the demands of our conscience and ensure no one goes hungry or cold. Similar initiatives were successful last winter, and we believe our community organizations can address the current need. Each community has made plans and estimates to meet their specific needs, and we trust that the generosity of each community will meet these estimates. This approach aligns with the responsibility and neighborly spirit upon which our nation is built. The suffering of helpless people concerns me greatly, and it is with this in mind that I ask citizens in each community to provide the necessary funds to meet this task. The spirit of mutual self-help and responsibility is crucial to the future of America. Supporting these services gives hope and courage to deserving families and strengthens the foundations of our democracy. The success and character of nations are determined by the ideals and spirit of their people. We must now awaken that spirit, unity, and determination to fulfill our primary obligation to our neighbors and citizens, ensuring none who deserve help suffer. We face more than a financial crisis; we face a question of human relations and the very soul of our society. No government action or economic plan can replace the responsibility of individuals to their neighbors. This trial is a test of our hearts and consciences. As we approach Thanksgiving, I urge the American people to make it a historic day by demonstrating our ideals and assuring our communities that we have eradicated the fear of hunger and cold during the upcoming winter.

Fortunately, we have a plan. This deficit reduction agreement, the largest ever, will save over $300 billion. It includes new enforcement rules and real spending cuts. It also raises revenue in a fair manner, without increasing income tax rates. This plan will create more jobs and lower interest rates, benefiting consumers and homeowners.

Some may find fault with certain aspects of this agreement, but we must look at the big picture. If we don't act, our economy will suffer, and we may even face a recession. Tonight, the Democratic and Republican leadership stand united in support of this agreement. We need your help to move it forward. Contact your Congressmen and Senators to express your support for this deficit reduction agreement. It's time to put politics aside and come together for the future of our nation.

This is a tough agreement for tough times, but it's fair and bipartisan. It's time to face this crisis head-on and demonstrate the resilience and determination of the American people. Together, we can overcome this budget crisis and pave the way for economic growth. Thank you, and good night.",8.5,positive

"I am deeply grateful for the warm welcome and response from your president. My strength lies in your confidence.

We are in a unique situation where we must consider international law and its role in uniting nations under common principles. International law is the moral force behind the creation of laws. The world's opinion is the ultimate judge, and international law is the slow process by which this opinion is enforced. This process differs from the ordinary rules of evidence, focusing instead on the character of the witness. We must be mindful of sound principles rather than self-interest. Acting with integrity is not only the right course but also the most profitable.

I want to bring attention to the application of these ideas in our municipal law. We rely too heavily on citations instead of principles. Shouldn't the law evolve organically from society rather than solely through statute? We should seek justice, not uphold outdated precedents. The law should be forward-thinking, considering the actual circumstances and moral judgments of humanity.

I am not criticizing the law but rather suggesting that we examine whether it aligns with moral judgments. We are caretakers of the spirit of justice, equality, and hope for the improvement of both law and human life. Public and private life are enriched by our belief in the beauty of the human spirit and its translation into action. Though we cannot exceed the average moral judgments of society, we must not lag behind. The voices of all, regardless of their background, should be heard in our courts, representing the general opinion and remembering the past while envisioning a better future.

In these extraordinary times, I hope we can rediscover the true essence of the law and its connection to divine guidance.",7.0,positive
"The purpose of this Council is to improve the moral and spiritual life of the Nation, and I believe that the success of our government relies on the religious convictions of our people. Our modern life has become more complex and interdependent, leading to increased opportunities for crime and perversion of government resources. War often leads to crime and violence, as it disrupts old restraints. There is a lack of respect for government and society, and a resistance to necessary restraints and discipline. The government's main role is to maintain order and provide security, but it cannot be responsible for providing the instrumentalities for spiritual life. The government can aid in solving some problems, but it can only truly be effective if there is a strong public sentiment to uphold the law. Education is valuable in combating ignorance, vice, and crime, but intellectual growth must be accompanied by moral growth. The government cannot be the source and motive for the reformation of society; it rests on religion. Our institutions were established based on religious beliefs, and without faith, our government would fail. Clergymen have made significant contributions to education and government, as the teachings of religion naturally relate to these areas. The government cannot rise above the people; it can only be as virtuous as they are. Restraint and punishment can protect society, but it does not reform individuals or make the community virtuous. True reform requires a more enlightened conscience, which comes from religion. The government needs the support of religion, not in a narrow sense, but encompassing all that falls within its broad definition. Society would be on the path to destruction without the influence of religion. Despite the difficulties and perils we face, our faith in religion has not diminished, and we are still maintaining the foundations of our institutions. The country needs more religion to address the failures in law enforcement and to combat the evils that plague society. Education and government will fail without the influences of religion. Redemption comes through sacrifice, which is the essence of religion. A broader understanding of this principle and continued preaching by the clergy will be beneficial. We must renew and extend our faith to improve the moral and spiritual life of the Nation. Without faith, our enlightened civilization cannot endure.",3.0,negative
"We face a critical moment in history, where our decisions today will shape the future for years to come. I recently visited Israel during a war, meeting with the Prime Minister and witnessing the pain and resilience of the Israeli people. Hamas has committed horrific acts of terror, but we must remember that they do not represent the Palestinian people. We mourn the loss of innocent lives in Israel and in Gaza. The conflict in Ukraine and Putin's aggression pose a threat not only to Ukraine but also to NATO Allies. We will defend our allies and not withdraw our support. It is crucial for America's national security to ensure the success of Israel and Ukraine. We must denounce antisemitism and Islamophobia and uphold our values of religious freedom and freedom of expression. To achieve a more peaceful and prosperous world, American leadership is essential. Therefore, I will request urgent funding from Congress to support our national security needs and critical partners like Israel and Ukraine. We must stand together as a great nation and work towards a better future.",6.0,positive

We will continue to support Iraq and help train and equip their forces. At home, our troops will be reunited with their families, and we will reflect on the sacrifices made in this war. The end of the war in Iraq is part of a larger transition as the tide of war recedes. We are also bringing our troops home from Afghanistan and achieving major victories against al Qaeda.

It is not just an economic victory, but a return to our founding principles of individual freedom and opportunity.

"By the President of the United States of America,
A Proclamation:
The northern boundary of Nebraska is being extended to include a portion of Dakota. Once the Indian title to the newly included lands is extinguished, Nebraska will have jurisdiction over the lands. The original right of soil will still belong to the United States. This act will only take effect once the President proclaims the Indian title extinguished and the State of Nebraska assents to the provisions. The act will cease to be effective if Nebraska does not consent within two years. Additionally, when allotments have been made to the Ponca tribe and other Indians on the mentioned lands, the Indian title to the remaining lands will be extinguished and will be open to settlement. Nebraska has already consented to the act extending its northern boundary. The Ponca tribe has already received their allotments, and the time limit for allotments has expired. Therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States, declare the Indian title extinguished for the lands not allotted to the Ponca tribe. A tract of land currently occupied by the old Ponca Agency buildings will be reserved from entry or settlement. This proclamation is done on October 23, 1890, in Washington, D.C.

"Upon commencing the current Session, I want to acknowledge the prosperous state of our country and express my confidence that this Session will lead to measures that promote national prosperity. We have many reasons to be grateful, including the abundance in the farming industry this year. Our observations confirm that agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, and navigation are progressing well. This is due, in part, to the revival of public and private confidence that the Constitution and Laws of the United States have facilitated. Our nation's reputation and credit have also improved. I am pleased to inform you that there has been rapid subscription to the Bank of the United States, demonstrating confidence in the government and available resources in our community.

During the recess, we have taken necessary steps to protect the Western Frontiers and establish peace with the Indians. However, these measures have not always been successful, leading to offensive operations to punish those who engage in depredations. Our overtures for peace with the tribes continue, and many individuals have chosen to renounce opposition and seek protection from the United States. We aim to establish a peaceful and prosperous relationship with the Indians through fair justice administration, defining land alienation processes, promoting equitable commerce, and assisting in their civilization. It is crucial that those who violate Indian rights suffer appropriate penalties.

I am pleased to report that the Act imposing duties on distilled spirits has been implemented, though adjustments may be necessary. While there has been some discontent due to the novelty of the tax, it can be resolved through proper explanations. It is essential to consider the wishes of the community and foster their affection towards the government.

We have determined and proclaimed a permanent seat for the government of the United States, along with plans for a city and progress in public building construction. The Census shows our population nearing four million. We have also completed a loan in Holland and expect another to be completed soon.

I present two treaties with the Cherokees and Six Nations of Indians for your consideration and ratification. I commend the previous efforts in establishing a new government, and I trust that the remaining important tasks will be executed with diligence for the benefit of the nation.

The results of the debt provision act have been substantial, with substantial subscriptions to the domestic debt and the debts of the respective states. Further deliberations are required regarding the remaining unsubscribed debt.

Our revenues appear to be adequate for now, alleviating the need for additional burden on the citizens. But we must address the current year's expenses, outstanding demands, and unforeseen circumstances.

There are several important matters that I must mention, including the militia, post-office and post-roads, the establishment of a mint, uniform weights and measures, and the sale of vacant lands.

The militia's organization is crucial for national security, public satisfaction, and maintaining order. Magazines, arsenals, and fortifications in vital areas should be considered.

The post-office and post-roads play a significant role in communication, knowledge dissemination, and protection against misrepresentation. Additional cross-posts are needed in important regions.

The disorder in the currency, especially the shortage of small change, is distressing for the less privileged. We need to establish a Mint to resolve this issue.

Uniform weights and measures are necessary for the country's convenience and are encouraged by the Constitution's mandate.

The sale of vacant lands is crucial for reimbursing the public debt and avoiding new taxes for debt repayment.

These are some of the matters that require your attention, and I have confidence in your ability to handle them effectively.",7.5,positive
"Your Honor, Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen:

As we gather here today to celebrate, we cannot help but be moved by the significance of this occasion. The spirits of those who came before us, though no longer visible, still influence us. The men who sat in this hall faced difficult problems and worked to create a lasting nation and an example for the world. They were not showmen, but principled and honorable public servants.

Politicians must comprehend and sympathize with the task at hand. Self-centered individuals have caused problems throughout our history, failing to see the bigger picture of equity, justice, and the rights of all. The Declaration of Independence was a pivotal moment, but the true substance of liberty lies in our bills of rights and the ability for people to choose their own government.

We must consider the circumstances of our own time and strive to give the American people, and the world, more liberty, happiness, and shared prosperity. Our task is complex, but it is important to keep our eyes, hearts, and understanding open to avoid irreversible mistakes. It is easy to lose sight of the rest of the country in Washington, but we must maintain connections with the people and remember our duty to them.

I admire the men who gathered in this hall. They were simple in their lives and understood the fundamental principles of government. We talk about these principles, but do we truly absorb them? Let us be men of principle and honor, freeing ourselves from temporary circumstances and embracing the ideals of freedom and justice for all.",5.5,positive

While the construction and building material industries are affected by high interest rates from stock speculation, this is a minor issue overall.

"I am honored to be here on this important occasion for this college and for art in the United States. This college is a part of our country, as was Mr. Frost. I was privileged to accept the invitation to speak here. The powers of the Presidency are often discussed, but its limitations should also be acknowledged. When I was asked by the Chairman of our Disarmament Advisory Committee, who has served this country for many years, there was only one response.

Amherst has had many successful graduates who have recognized their responsibility to serve the public interest. Private colleges in general draw students from the wealthiest percent of the population. The lower income families have a significantly smaller portion of the total income. It is important for graduates to recognize their responsibility to society.

Our country faces immense challenges at home and abroad. We need the help of educated individuals to create jobs, navigate international relations, and promote diversity and harmony. This requires the best from all of us.

I am proud to be at this college that recognizes the need to serve the public interest. I hope that the current students will continue to do so in the future. Today, we remember Robert Frost, who was both an artist and an American. He brought a deep faith in the human spirit and questioned the power of society. Poetry reminds us of our limitations, the richness of life, and cleanses corruption. Art should be free from propaganda and should serve as a form of truth. Artists should be true to themselves and their nation.

I envision a future where America combines its strength with moral restraint, and rewards achievement in the arts. A future where we protect our natural environment, preserve our national heritage, and build beautiful cities. An America that commands respect for its civilization and a world that is safe for democracy and personal distinction.

"Good evening, fellow Americans. I would like to address the progress we have made in our peace negotiations in Vietnam. Discussions with North Vietnam have been ongoing since May in Paris. Our goal was to initiate talks for a settlement and we stopped bombing North Vietnam in the region where most of the people live. However, there was no movement in the talks for several weeks. Recently, there has been a more hopeful phase. I have conducted intensive discussions with our allies and military leaders to assess the prospects for peace. Last Sunday, confirmation of our essential understanding with North Vietnam was received. As a result, I have ordered the cessation of all air, naval, and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam. This decision is based on the progress in the Paris talks and the belief that it can lead to a peaceful resolution of the war. The representatives of the South Vietnamese government will be attending the next session of talks, along with representatives of the National Liberation Front. This does not mean a stable peace has been achieved yet, and we expect hard negotiations ahead. However, we are committed to saving human lives and will determine if progress is possible in good faith. We are prepared for any contingencies and hope for swift negotiations with the common intent of peace. The timing of events in Hanoi determined when we could stop the bombing, and the participation of the South Vietnamese government was a necessary condition. The progress in talks is attributed to the growing strength of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces, supported by the superb performance of our own forces. Now, we need steady determination and patience from the American people to support us in this hour of trial. I have dedicated myself to seeking peace in Southeast Asia and have kept all presidential candidates informed of developments.

"Tonight, I want to discuss the situation in Syria and why it is important. The peaceful protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime have turned into a brutal civil war resulting in the deaths of over 100,000 people and millions fleeing the country. While America has provided humanitarian support and assistance to the moderate opposition, I have refrained from military action due to the belief that we cannot solve someone else's civil war through force after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the situation changed on August 21st when Assad's government used chemical weapons to kill over a thousand people, including children. This is a violation of international law and a danger to our security. If we do not act, Assad will not stop using chemical weapons, other dictators may acquire them, and our troops may face chemical warfare. These weapons could also pose a threat to our allies and weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, I have decided that a targeted military strike is in the national security interests of the United States to deter Assad from using chemical weapons and make it clear that we will not tolerate their use. However, as the President of a constitutional democracy, I believe it is important to seek the support of Congress before taking this action. I understand that after Iraq and Afghanistan, military action is not popular, but I assure you that this will not lead to another war, and it will be a limited strike to achieve a specific objective. We have also seen progress through diplomacy and talks with Russia, and we will continue to pursue diplomatic solutions to remove the threat of chemical weapons. I have asked Congress to delay their vote on military action while we pursue this diplomatic path. We will maintain our military posture to pressure Assad and be prepared to respond if diplomacy fails.

"President Pitzer, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley, and Congressman Miller, Mr. Webb. Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen:

I am grateful for the honor of being made an honorary visiting professor and I promise that my first lecture will be brief.

I am thrilled to be here on this special occasion. We gather at a renowned college, in a progressive city, in a strong state, and we need all three qualities because we are living in a time of change and challenge, hope and fear, knowledge and ignorance. As our knowledge increases, so does our realization of how much we do not know.

In just 50 years, mankind has made astounding progress. We have advanced from using animal skins for clothing to constructing shelters, developing writing and using wheeled carts, starting Christianity, inventing the printing press, harnessing steam power, exploring gravity, creating electric lights, telephones, automobiles, and airplanes, discovering penicillin and television, and now venturing into nuclear power and space travel.

This rapid pace of progress brings both benefits and drawbacks. Space exploration presents new risks and costs, but also great rewards.

Some may argue that we should stay where we are and rest, but history shows that progress is made by those who keep moving forward. We cannot afford to fall behind in the race for space if we want to maintain our position as a leading nation.

Our predecessors ensured that America led the industrial revolutions, modern inventions, and the use of nuclear power. It is our duty to continue this legacy and become the leading space-faring nation. The eyes of the world are on space, and we must ensure it is governed by principles of freedom and peace, rather than conquest and war.

Space exploration offers new knowledge and rights that can benefit all people. However, it is up to us to decide how it is used. The United States must take the lead in space exploration to shape its peaceful and cooperative future.

We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard. This challenge will bring out the best in us and unite our energies and skills. We are determined to reach the moon within this decade and achieve victory in this endeavor.

Shifting our efforts in space to high gear was one of the most significant decisions of my presidency. We have witnessed incredible advancements in space exploration within the past 24 hours alone, with the testing of a powerful rocket and the creation of new facilities. Our satellites have provided invaluable knowledge to the world, surpassing those of the Soviet Union.

While we may be behind in manned flight, we will catch up and move forward in this decade. Space exploration will not only enhance science and education but also create new industries, jobs, and opportunities. Houston, with its Manned Spacecraft Center, will become a hub of scientific and engineering advancements.

These endeavors require substantial funding, but we have prioritized the space program as a nation. We recognize that the benefits of space exploration may be unknown, but we have faith and vision in its potential. We must be bold and act decisively to accomplish our goal of reaching the moon before the end of this decade.

I am proud that this university is contributing to this monumental effort. As George Mallory once said about climbing Mount Everest, we explore space simply because it is there. We embark on this great adventure with God's blessing and the hope for knowledge and peace.

Thank you.",6.5,positive
"Welcome, Prime Minister Rabin, Chairman Arafat, and esteemed guests. Today is a historic occasion, as we witness a significant step towards peace in the Middle East. The conflict between Palestinians and Jews has caused immense suffering, but today we have hope for a better future. 14 years ago, the Camp David accords laid the foundation for peace between Egypt and Israel, proving that peace is possible. Two years ago, in Madrid, President Bush brought Israel and its neighbors together for direct negotiations. Today, we celebrate the signing of a declaration of principles on interim Palestinian self-government. This agreement paves the way for reconciliation and a shared future shaped by the values of three major religions. We commend the leadership of Prime Minister Rabin, Foreign Minister Peres, and Chairman Arafat. This achievement must inspire progress in all aspects of the peace process. We know there will be challenges, but we must remain committed to peace. The United States is dedicated to supporting this work and ensuring the security of those affected by this agreement. Together, we can imagine the possibilities if all the energy invested in this struggle is redirected towards building a prosperous and peaceful land. Let us not forget the importance of the next generation and the need to protect their future. The children of Abraham have embarked on a journey towards peace, and today we wish them shalom, salaam, peace.",8.0,positive

"The President of the United States issues a proclamation to address the uprising in Louisiana. Turbulent individuals are attempting to overthrow the state government and resist the law. The President, in accordance with the Constitution, is obligated to protect the state from domestic violence. The legislature is unable to convene, so the executive has requested military assistance. The President commands the instigators to disperse peacefully within five days and urges citizens to support the law. This proclamation is issued on September 15, 1874, in Washington, D.C.",3.0,negative
"In my first week as President, I ordered a report on young Americans who have evaded the draft or deserted the military. At the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, I announced my plan to give these young people a chance to contribute to society. I am committed to healing our nation and following precedents set by past presidents. Developing fair procedures has been challenging, but we have finally completed our work. Today, I am signing the necessary documents to put this plan into effect. The program involves alternate service and a clemency review board for those already convicted. The goal is to reconcile our people and restore unity. This is a constructive step toward a calmer future for our nation. Thank you.",6.5,positive
"At Camp David, we asked people to pray for the success of our negotiations, and those prayers have been answered beyond expectations. We have achieved a significant milestone in the cause of peace, thanks to the courage and wisdom of these leaders. It took determination, vision, and flexibility during the 13 days at Camp David to make this agreement possible.

While there are still challenges to overcome, we must recognize the substantial achievements made. One of the agreements signed tonight is called ""A Framework for Peace in the Middle East."" It outlines principles for a comprehensive peace settlement, including a 5-year transitional period for the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians will have a say in their future, and negotiations will be based on UN Resolution 242.

Another document, ""Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty Between Egypt and Israel,"" ensures Egyptian sovereignty over the Sinai and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. These agreements provide the basis for progress and peace in the Middle East.

The only remaining disagreement is regarding the removal of Israeli settlements from Egyptian territory, which Egypt sees as a prerequisite to a peace treaty, but Israel believes should be resolved during negotiations. The Knesset will decide on this issue in the coming weeks.

I will explain these agreements in more detail in my speech to Congress tomorrow. For now, I want to express my admiration for those involved in this process and my hope that the promise of this moment will be fulfilled. The negotiations have been challenging, but the leaders and their advisors found the resources to keep the chances for peace alive.

While the long days at Camp David are over, there are still months of difficult negotiations ahead. I hope the wisdom that led to the success of this session will guide leaders of all nations as they continue the progress toward peace. Thank you.",7.0,positive
"My fellow citizens of the radio audience,
The radio has brought us closer together, allowing us to become more familiar with our surroundings and fellow citizens. I am speaking to you from the President's study in the White House. This room has been a place of work and accomplishment for over a century, where many of our great Presidents have worked and made important decisions. It holds the memories of their courage and achievements.
Throughout our history, the constant problem has been to maintain and strengthen peace. Every President has desired peace and prayed for it, while also being prepared for defense. We have never had a President who was solely a pacifist or militarist. The thought of our Presidents has always been to have adequate defense as an assurance of peace, without going beyond what is necessary. We have also made advancements in conciliation, arbitration, and judicial settlement of disputes to prevent war. Recently, we and other nations have pledged not to use war as a national policy, and now we are working towards reducing and limiting naval arms. This would not only benefit our national security but also alleviate the burden on our workers and promote a world free from fear and animosity. The success of these negotiations is crucial for the confidence and progress of humanity.",7.0,positive
"I appreciate the introduction and believe the introducer is a good prophet. I've had a great tour today and have been met with enthusiastic crowds everywhere. I feel that Iowa is awakening to the situation and will vote Democratic on November 2nd. The Democratic Party has provided farmers with support programs, conservation efforts, electrification, and crop insurance, leading to unprecedented prosperity. In 1932, many farmers lost their farms, while in 1947, very few foreclosures occurred. Farmers' debt has decreased by over 50% and they now have $18 billion in assets. Some people want to return to the conditions of low wages and depressed agricultural prices of the past, but the price support program has allowed for immense production and saved millions of lives. It's important to read history, use your own judgment, and decide if you want to move forward with the Democratic Party or return to the ineffective 80th Congress. This Congress tried to strip rights from labor, return farmers to a dire situation, and harm small businesses to benefit big interests. The influence of lobbies in Washington has reached unprecedented levels, spending large sums to gain special privileges in the ""do-nothing"" Congress. You'll be in trouble if you don't exercise your right to vote. By staying home in 1946, you got the 80th Congress, but now you have another chance to make a difference. If you let that chance slip, I won't have sympathy for you. However, if you seize the opportunity, you'll help me stay in the White House for another 4 years. It has been a pleasure being in Iowa and riding with your public officials. The Democratic candidate for Governor and Guy Gillette, whom I served with in the Senate, are both exceptional individuals. I hope you'll elect them, along with other Democratic officials. I appreciate the support and turnout I've seen today. I believe the people of Iowa appreciate their President and what he's doing for the common people.",7.0,positive
"I am delighted to be here in Missouri, the first town we have stopped in since leaving Washington. Today, I had the pleasure of spending the day with the next Governor of Missouri, Forrest Smith. We attended a meeting in Des Moines and he has been with me ever since. Despite not needing an introduction in Missouri, Forrest will have the honor of presenting the President of the United States at our first stop in the state.

Forrest Smith and I, along with every other Democrat on the ticket, are confident of carrying this state. Trenton holds a special place in my heart, as I have fond memories of living here and working in Kansas City many years ago. I hope you will consider the issues and exercise your right to vote, as we all have a role in shaping our government. In the previous election, voter turnout was low, resulting in the 80th Congress, which has been one of the worst for the public's welfare.

By voting on November 2nd, you have the opportunity to rectify this and also elect Forrest Smith as Governor of Missouri. Together, we can work towards the welfare of everyday Americans, without favoring special interests. As Abraham Lincoln once said, the Lord must have loved the common people since there are so many of them. I believe in the potential of Missouri, the greatest state in the Union. Let us join forces to maintain a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, ensuring that our great country remains the best in the world for centuries to come.",7.5,positive
"In 1946, President Harry Truman welcomed representatives of 55 nations to the first General Assembly of the United Nations. Today, I welcome you all as representatives of 138 nations. We have the opportunity to make this century an era of peace, cooperation, and economic well-being. The United States commits to pursuing a more peaceful and stable world through mutual restraint with the Soviet Union. We will strengthen partnerships with traditional friends and foster new relationships with old adversaries. We will strive for justice, equality, and freedom, and we recognize that no single nation or group can meet all the challenges we face. We must act together. The prevention of full-scale warfare is a shared responsibility. The United Nations must place the weight of the world community on the side of peace and provide impartial forces to maintain it. We are united by a deep concern for peace and a desire for a better life for all. The world economy is facing unprecedented stress, and we need new approaches to international cooperation. We must address the global challenges of food and energy through increased production, affordable prices, and fair distribution. We must avoid using commodities for political purposes and ensure that the poorest among us are not overwhelmed by rising prices. The United States will substantially increase assistance to agricultural production programs in other countries and contribute to the establishment of an international system of food reserves. We call on oil producers to define a global policy on energy without imposing burdens on the international system. Economic confrontation cannot lead to political cooperation. By working together, we can turn from fear towards hope. No nation can be expected to feed all the world's hungry peoples, but many nations are able to help. We call on them to join us in the struggle to provide more food at lower prices and a better life for the needy. There are limits to our capacities, but there is no limit to our determination to act in concert with other nations to fulfill the vision of the United Nations Charter. Thank you very much.",5.0,negative
"Citizens of the Senate & House: I called this session early to address Treasury needs and negotiate with Great Britain. The outcome of peace or war is uncertain. While peace seems possible, Britain's refusal of mediation and aggressive actions suggest a continued hostility towards us. Despite some setbacks, we have had victories against the enemy, proving our strength. We have defended our borders and gained support from Indian tribes. Our naval forces have also been successful, despite some losses. Our private cruisers continue to disrupt enemy commerce. We must strengthen our military and make necessary financial provisions to meet the demands of the war. Our enemy is powerful and seeks to harm us, but our spirit and determination will prevail. The American people will face this adversity with bravery and determination. We will bear any burden to protect our country. Our constituents have already shown their patriotism and willingness to contribute to the cause. We have tried to avoid war, but the capture of our vessels and the refusal to revoke hostile orders left us no choice. We still desire peace, but will meet our enemy with unwavering strength. The world supports us and we trust in a higher power to guide us.",6.5,positive
"I deeply appreciate this opportunity to address such a distinguished audience today. The topic I wish to discuss is Vietnam. Our people are deeply concerned about this struggle and many have doubts about our commitment. Vietnam poses complex problems, including political turmoil, poverty, religious and factional strife, and a hunger for freedom. Vietnam is also the scene of an aggressive communist expansion that threatens free people. The question is, why have three presidents chosen to defend Vietnam? The answer lies in our commitment to freedom, self-determination, and the desire to prevent political and bodily murder. Our own security is also at stake, as aggression in Vietnam may pose a threat to the United States and the world's peace and security. The consequences of abandoning Vietnam would be dire, and we cannot risk letting armed aggression succeed. The stakes are high, as President Eisenhower and Kennedy have stated. The presidents and leaders of Asian and Pacific nations have also expressed their concerns about the threat of communism spreading. We cannot simply hope that a communist conquest of Southeast Asia won't lead to a larger war. We must take action now to reduce this danger. Progress is being made in Vietnam, both politically and militarily. The South Vietnamese people have bravely voted for an elected government, and military progress is being made against the enemy. There are questions about negotiating peace, and I assure you we are ready to negotiate. However, Hanoi has consistently refused to engage in productive discussions. They hope for a breakdown in our morale and believe they can outlast us. This underestimation of our democracy and resolve is a mistake. We will continue seeking negotiations while pursuing our policy until reason prevails. Throughout history, we have met and overcome challenges to ensure peace and security. Freedom cannot be sacrificed for peace, and we must defend our frontiers through honorable means. The true peacekeepers are the soldiers fighting on the frontlines and the civilians providing aid to the Vietnamese people. We must not mislead the enemy by wavering or withdrawing, and we will provide all necessary support for our brave men. They have our prayers and gratitude, and we will prevail with their backing.",6.0,positive
"The court orders in the case of Meredith versus Fair are being carried out. James Meredith is now at the University of Mississippi, without the use of National Guard or other troops. It is hoped that law enforcement officials will continue to be enough in the future. Everyone should be able to return to normal activities with confidence in American law. We are founded on the principle that observance of the law is essential for liberty. We are free to disagree with the law but not to disobey it. If anyone could defy the commands of the court, our laws would be in doubt and citizens would not be safe. Mr. Meredith brought a suit in federal court and the Supreme Court repeatedly ordered his admission to the University. The United States Court of Appeals stated that it was the government's obligation to enforce the court's order. I federalized the Mississippi National Guard to preserve law and order. Persuasion and conciliation were not successful. Had the police powers of Mississippi been used to support the court's orders, federal intervention would not have been necessary. We appreciate the progress made by southern states in allowing students of all races into state-supported universities. We are all responsible for any failures in race relations. Mississippi and its University have a tradition of courage and contribution. The students have an opportunity to show patriotism and integrity. Upholding the law is your responsibility. The eyes of the nation and the world are on you. Let us close this case in the manner directed by the court, preserve the law and peace, and then address other crises united in our pledge to freedom.",8.5,positive
"President Milburn, Director General Buchanan, Commissioners, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am glad to be in Buffalo and greet its people. I welcome the foreign representatives at this exposition, who have contributed to its success. Expositions stimulate progress, providing education and improving daily life. They promote friendly competition and inspire improvement. Trade encourages innovation and efficiency. The Pan-American exposition showcases the progress of the western hemisphere and invites friendly rivalry for the benefit of humanity. Modern inventions have brought people closer, erasing distances. Communication has become easier and faster. We must work together to settle disputes through arbitration. Our country is prosperous, but we must seek more markets. Reciprocity and good trade relations are important. We need better steamship service and should encourage our merchant marine. We must build the Isthmian canal and a pacific cable.

"Condensed Text:

Tonight, I address the Korean airline massacre - the Soviet Union's attack on an unarmed Korean passenger plane. We must not forget this crime against humanity. Our prayers are with the victims and their families. We mourn the loss of brave individuals like Kathryn McDonald. The Soviets have a history of shooting down civilian airliners. There is no justification for their actions. Other countries do not engage in such practices. The Soviets refuse to admit their guilt and have given conflicting stories. However, we have evidence, including a tape of the Soviet pilots discussing the attack. The Soviets owe the world an apology and a commitment to prevent this from happening again. We are taking steps to make the skies safer, seek compensation for the families of the victims, and hold the Soviets accountable. We have received international support in denouncing the Soviet action. We will work with other countries to seek justice. Our resolve to remain strong and united is evident. Defense spending must be maintained to deter Soviet aggression. We must continue efforts to bring the Soviets into the world community and pursue arms reductions. Though it will be challenging, we must try to make them stop using force. We have a duty to do what is right. Through courage and unity, we can find some good in this tragedy.

"The President of the United States declares that the war is not driven by oppression or conquest but to defend the Constitution and preserve the Union. Proclamations have been issued to offer amnesty and pardon to those involved in the rebellion, with certain exceptions. As the rebellion subsides and the citizens show loyalty, the President believes it is necessary to modify the proclamation and extend the pardon to more individuals. However, certain individuals, including the former Confederate government officials and those involved in the assassination of the late President, are excluded from the benefits. The President emphasizes the importance of constitutional law and order and requires individuals seeking pardon to take an oath.

"Mr. Secretary General and esteemed leaders from throughout our hemisphere, thank you for joining us today. This is a historic occasion with the largest gathering of heads of state in the Hall of the Americas. We are here to sign treaties that will ensure a secure and prosperous future for an important international waterway. These treaties signify the United States' commitment to fairness in our global relationships. They also guarantee the neutrality of the Panama Canal, benefiting all nations that use it. Panama will have a greater role in the canal's operation and defense, while the United States will protect its neutrality in the future. Other nations will have the opportunity to support the canal's permanent neutrality. These accords also provide economic incentives for Panama and establish a partnership for the waterway's success. In the spirit of reciprocity, any future sea-level canal will be built in Panama with U.S. cooperation. We appreciate the support and concern expressed by many leaders on this issue. This agreement is the result of 14 years of negotiation under four U.S. Presidents and bipartisan efforts. It symbolizes our commitment to fairness, equality, and mutual respect. It marks a new chapter in our relations with the hemisphere and showcases the maturity and goodwill of our people. This is a significant milestone for cooperation among all nations.

"I regretfully return the bill ""to provide for the better collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be styled the Fiscal Corporation of the United States"" to the House of Representatives. In my previous message to the Senate, I stated my opposition to the power of Congress to create a national bank. My objection to this bill is based on my moral obligation to uphold the Constitution. While the veto power should be used cautiously, it must be exercised when it involves the public interest or goes against the oath of the President. The Constitution represents the will of the people and must be protected. The bill in question creates a national bank that operates across the Union. Its provisions and powers make it clear that it is a bank of the United States. The bill allows for objectionable forms of discounts and lacks limits on premiums in the purchase of bills of exchange. Additionally, it disadvantages certain cities and prevents the resumption of specie payments. The bill has other flaws that make it unwise to become law. I have striven to meet Congress' wishes for a fiscal agent that is constitutional and avoids controversy, but I cannot support this bill. I hope that we can find a way to unite and address the country's financial needs at a future time. My convictions are based on upholding the Constitution and I would rather face criticism than compromise my duty and conscience.",8.0,positive
"Madam President, the women's movement has grown rapidly throughout history, from a handful of women to a great multitude. Initially, the United States had a mechanical conception of government, but with the slavery question, women became prominent in politics and began addressing social and moral issues. As our society has changed, political questions have shifted from legal to social matters. The force and power of this movement are undeniable, driven by women who have seen visions of duty. We must understand that we are dealing with the essence of life itself, and while we may debate methods, the movement will ultimately succeed. We must work together and wait for the masses to follow. The force behind this movement will surely triumph, and we can afford to be patient.",8.5,positive
